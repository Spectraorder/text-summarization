"Student demonstrators who walked on an American flag to protest racism sparked a countermovement, prompting a south Georgia university to cancel classes Friday ahead of a rally that drew hundreds to Valdosta. Valdosta State University found itself in the center of a controversy after a video shared on social media showed an Air Force veteran and former Playboy model, Michelle Manhart, taking an American flag from demonstrators who had walked on it to protest racism. At the protest, held a week ago, Manhart was detained by police when she refused to return the flag. Big rally: Flag supporters attend a rally on Friday in Valdosta, Georgia that caused the Valdosta State University to close down for the day . Closed: Uproar over a protest in which demonstrators walked on an American flag has prompted a south Georgia university to cancel classes ahead of the rally expected to draw crowds of flag supporters to Valdosta . Struggle: Manhart, 38, is shown, left, refusing to release a flag which protesters were trampling on. In the right-hand photograph she is seen being arrested at Valdosta State University in Georgia . Hunt: Police said they traced the gun to a protester who was part of the flag-walking demonstration, and they issued a warrant for Eric Sheppard's arrest on charges of bringing a firearm onto a college campus . She later was banned from the campus of 11,500 students. She was not a student at Valdosta State, according to the school. The flag-walking demonstration involved three protesters, university spokesman Andy Clark said. Meanwhile, tensions rose at Valdosta State when campus police found a backpack containing a handgun on Tuesday. Police said they traced the gun to a protester who was part of the flag-walking demonstration, and they issued a warrant for Eric Sheppard's arrest on charges of bringing a firearm onto a college campus. Sheppard fled and has not been found by authorities, Clark said. Flag supporters gathered for a rally Friday afternoon, and university administrators said the possibility of thousands of people rallying on the outskirts of campus ultimately led to the decision to give students a day off. 'That level of traffic and that many people will disrupt a lot of things in the city,' Clark said. 'We're from an overall safety perspective looking to close the campus down today so they can have a peaceful rally.' Organizers of the 'Flags Over VSU' rally said they expected as many as 4,000 people Friday afternoon, WALB-TV reported . University administrators arranged for extra police to be on campus to provide security during the rally, Clark told The Valdosta Daily Times. Local law enforcement officials said the crowd that gathered was generally peaceful. Pro-flag: A flag supporter waves a large American flag while attending a rally on Friday in support of the flag . In support: Flag supporters on motorbikes attend a rally on Friday in support of Michelle Manhart . University administrators faced a backlash on social media after Manhart was issued a criminal trespass warning, essentially banning her from campus. Critics saw the university as siding with demonstrators who walked on the flag over a military veteran trying to save it. 'We were protecting their right to free speech and civil liberties' without taking sides, Clark said. NBC reports that some people T-shirts with the American flag and the words 'Try walking on this flag' written on the back and others carried signs. Cover girl: After her original feature, Manhart appeared in Playboy again. She is shown here on the cover of the Mexican edition . NBC spoke with Kim Thompson who drove 30 miles to join in the rally. 'I think it's going to be amazing. I think it's actually going to be part of history,' she said. Thompson, the wife of a sailor, said that after September 11 she became more patriotic than ever and felt that she needed to speak up after watching the flag get trampled. Michelle Manhart, 38, was handcuffed by police at Valdosta State University, Georgia, and driven off in a patrol car after grabbing the Stars and Stripes and refusing to return it to the student demonstrators last week. Video footage of the event, last Friday, shows Manhart struggling with officers, who force her to the ground after she refuses to let the flag go. It shows her surrounded by protesters on the campus, who demand their property be returned. In response, Manhart says the flag belongs to 'the entire United States'. Campus police try to convince her to drop the flag, but Manhart, a former training sergeant who served in Kuwait, refuses. Speaking to the Valdosta Daily Times about her intervention, she said: 'I did not want anything like this, but I got a call from a student who told me that the flag was on the ground, and they were walking on it. 'I was just going over there to pick up the flag off the ground. I don’t know what their cause is, but I went to pick it up because it doesn’t deserve to be on the ground.' She continued: 'If your cause is racism then find some white people and walk on them. 'But to walk on the flag is walking on our symbol of freedom. You have the freedom to do what you are doing because of it. I’m not fighting against them. I’m fighting against the way they are going about it.' Cause: Manhart came to the campus because she heard students were walking on the flag, as seen above . Air Force to bare force: Manhart was once a Staff Sergeant at the San Antonio Air Force training camp (right), but was demoted when she appeared nude in Playboy magazine. She is shown left holding a copy of the issue containing her spread . According to the Daily Times, the group didn't want to press charges against Manhart. However, police gave her a trespass warning, which bans her from the campus. Manhart has come under fire for standing up for her beliefs before. In 2007 she made national headlines - and lost her job - for posing nude for Playboy magazine. Explicit photographs from the periodical's February 2007 issue show then-Sergeant Manhart in a variety of provocative poses - first with, then later without - her military uniform. When Air Force bosses got wind of the racy feature, they relieved her of her duties at the Lackland Air Force Base in San Antonio, Texas. She was later demoted, and ultimately left the Air Force. However, she remained defiant, telling reporters at the time 'I didn't do anything wrong, so I didn't think it would be a major issue'. The decision brought an end to 14 years of service . She later appeared in other editions of Playboy - including the cover of the Mexican edition -  and posed for animal rights group Peta to support an anti-fur campaign. The Daily Times reported that Manhart now intends to hold a pro-military counter-demonstration in the town on Wednesday. In response to the incident, the university's president says he disapproves of the flag-trampling protest, but recognizes their right to express themselves that way if they choose. Dr William McKinney said: 'The American flag represents everything that is best about our country. As the Supreme Court has held, one of those things is the right to free speech, which includes the right to disrespect even the symbol of our country. 'While I firmly disagree with the actions of the protesters, I understand their right to protest.'","Hundreds protested an Air Force vet and former Playboy model's arrest when she tried to stop people from trampling on a flag .

"France set themselves up for their last-day showdown with title-chasing England at Twickenham by shutting out Italy in Rome yesterday. Coach Philippe Saint-Andre praised his side’s resilience after they bounced back from two successive defeats in the Six Nations to overcome Italy in a scrappy match. Les Bleus scored two tries and five penalties to seal an emphatic victory at the Stadio Olimpico after a dour first half in which a wet ball and rain-soaked pitch led both sides into a string of handling errors.

Dusautoir acknowledged that after defeats by Ireland and Wales, France were under pressure to produce ahead of the trip to Twickenham. ‘It was a big test today. In our last few matches, we weren’t able to find this defiance, or quality or this hunger,’ he said. ‘The first half maybe wasn’t very productive but it wore them down and it allowed us to end the match well,’ he said.

"A five-year-old boy has been left traumatised after he was lured behind a building at his school and attacked by five  classmates before being made to face them again  just an hour later. Ewan Potter was kicked and punched in the playground of Living Faith Lutheran Primary School at Murrumba Downs in Brisbane's north two weeks ago. He was left with some 'cracking bruises' and clear psychological effects, but his father Anthony says the young boys responsible got away with just a slap on the wrist. Ewan Potter was kicked and punched in the playground of Living Faith Lutheran Primary School at Murrumba Downs in Brisbane's north two weeks ago . Mr Potter was told by the school the group of boys - aged five and six - organised for the on-duty teacher to be distracted so they could carry out the attack on February 26. 'Ewan told me he was tricked into playing with the boys. They lured him behind the building and when he tried to run away they chased him and caught him,' Mr Potter told Daily Mail Australia. 'They dragged him back and started kicking and punching. 'The bruises are still there on his knees. He had a couple on his arms and chest. Luckily he didn't have any broken bones or blood gushing out.' His parents were only notified of the incident several hours after it happened because the school tried to sort out the situation using a method known as 'restorative practice'. 'They made Ewan go back to face all five boys so they could see what the bullying had done to him - how traumatic is that?' he said. 'He went to sleep that night with a stick to protect himself. I sat on the floor of his bedroom.' Ewan was left with some 'cracking bruises' and clear psychological effects, but his father Anthony (right) says the young boys responsible got away with just a slap on the wrist . Ewan, pictured here with his sister, was kicked and punched behind a school building by five young boys . Four of the boys remained in the same class with Ewan the next day, while the little boy who admitted to being 'the boss of the group' was moved to another classroom. 'It's gang violence. I can't believe six-year-olds can be pre-meditating attacks like this. One admitted to being the boss and getting four others involved,' Mr Potter said. The parents of all five children were called in and given behavioural orders  to work on at home, while age-appropriate consequences were enforced at school. Principal Jane Mueller said the school  had taken swift action and were 'saddened' by the bullying. 'I fully understand the concerns of parents of any child impacted by such an incident, and by the same token, I'm also conscious of our responsibility to teach these very young students at the infancy of their school career what is right and wrong,' she told the Courier Mail. Ewan's parents were only notified of the incident several hours after it happened because the school tried to sort out the situation using a method known as 'restorative practice' Ms Mueller said  the boys involved were still being monitored in the playground and consequences were being implemented at home with the support of parents. 'No matter what these parents do at home to help them, these kids have got away with a slap on the wrist. If we keep letting them get away with violence, how is it going to stop,' Mr Potter said. 'For my own child's safety I have to rely on other parents to take a proactive approach.' Mr Potter said he was hesitant to take Ewan back to school the day after he was bullied but didn't want him to fear it altogether. 'I just sat him down and told him what they did was wrong. I still sit there asking if he's okay. He's been really quiet and shut down. 'I don't know how much it's going to affect him. I still can't believe it happened.'","Ewan Potter was attacked by classmates at Brisbane school last month . Boy, five, was left with 'cracking bruises' after being kicked and punched .

"(CNN) -- Former Philippine President Corazon Aquino, whose ""People Power"" movement pushed out longtime strongman Ferdinand Marcos less than three years after her husband's assassination, has died at age 76, her family announced Saturday. ""She was the agent of change in Philippine democracy,"" said Ray Donato, the nation's consul-general in Atlanta. Aquino, the first woman to lead the Philippines, had been battling colon cancer since March 2008 and died of cardio-respiratory arrest at 3:18 a.m. Saturday (3:18 p.m. Friday ET), said Mai Mislang, a spokeswoman for her son, Philippine Sen. Benigno Aquino III. Funeral arrangements were being set up, Mislang said.  Philippine President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo has also announced a 10-day mourning period for the former president, said Ray Donato, the country's consul-general in Atlanta. ""She was the agent of change in Philippine democracy, and almost all the Filipinos I know revered her during her presidency,"" Donato said. Aquino had been born into a wealthy family and was educated in the United States. She had not been involved in politics before her husband, opposition leader Benigno ""Ninoy"" Aquino Jr., was gunned down at Manila's airport in August 1983 as he returned from exile. The political novice took over the leadership of her husband's movement after his death and challenged Marcos in a 1986 election, making a yellow dress her trademark and bolstered by the support of the country's Roman Catholic churches. Marcos had been backed by the United States, the former colonial power in the Philippines, for two decades as a stalwart anti-communist. He and his wife Imelda were friends of then-President Ronald Reagan and his wife, Nancy. But widespread allegations of electoral fraud and a mutiny by the country's military led the Reagan administration to withdraw its support, and Marcos went into exile in Hawaii. Aquino took office in a country with a $28 billion debt, widespread poverty and a persistent Marxist insurgency. She put in place a U.S.-style constitution that limited presidents to a single six-year term and survived seven coup attempts -- including one that was supressed with American help. She also oversaw the closure of the major U.S. military bases in the country before leaving office in 1992. The bases had been a bulwark of American power in the Pacific since the early 1900s and employed nearly 80,000 Filipinos, but Aquino's opponents argued the country was too dependent on the United States. Aquino announced in 1990 that it was time to begin negotiating the ""orderly withdrawal"" of U.S. forces.","NEW: Funeral arrangements are being set up, spokeswoman says .

"(CNN)Angelina Jolie took the stage Saturday at Nickelodeon's 28th Annual Kids' Choice Awards and delivered a message of hope to anyone who's ever felt out of place. In her first public appearance since revealing that she underwent a second preventive surgery to lower her risk of cancer, Jolie attended the show with her children, Shiloh and Zahara. She hugged them before she went to the stage to accept the favorite villain award for her role as Maleficent in the live-action reimagining of ""Sleeping Beauty."" ""When I was little, like Maleficent, I was told that I was different.  And I felt out of place -- too loud, too full of fire, never good at sitting still, never good at fitting in,"" the 39-year-old actor and humanitarian said. ""And, then one day I realized something, something that I hope you all realize: Different is good,"" she said, prompting enthusiastic screams from the young crowd. ""And, as your villain, I would also say cause a little trouble -- it's good for you."" Jolie's career has been full of unconventional twists and turns, from her breakthrough role in the biopic ""Gia"" to her current role as an actor, filmmaker and special envoy of the U.N.'s High Commissioner for Refugees. Her personal life also has made front page headlines over the years, including her adoption of children from developing countries and her candor in discussing her health. Jolie, 39, wrote Tuesday in a New York Times essay that she had opted for the surgery after blood tests revealed markers that might have been an indication of early cancer. Two years ago, she underwent a double mastectomy for similar reasons. Jolie's mother died of ovarian cancer, and the actress has a gene mutation that makes her chances of developing breast cancer and ovarian cancer much higher than the overall population. Jolie's revelation provoked an outpouring of support as the news spread across social media. ""It is not easy to make these decisions. But it is possible to take control and tackle head-on any health issue. You can seek advice, learn about the options and make choices that are right for you.

"Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger accepted his side were 'a bit lucky' after a fumble from Reading goalkeeper Adam Federici handed them a 2-1 extra-time victory and a place in the FA Cup final. The Gunners will head back to Wembley on May 30 aiming to defend the trophy after edging past the Sky Bet Championship side, who had rallied after going behind just before half-time to a fine goal from Alexis Sanchez. Reading drew level on 54 minutes when Garath McCleary's volley was deflected past goalkeeper Wojciech Szczesny, who could only palm the ball back over the line. Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger accepted his side were 'a bit lucky' to beat Reading on Saturday . Wenger's side failed to hit the level seen in recent games against Reading at Wembley . Although Arsenal did twice hit the woodwork through a header from defender Gabriel, which was touched onto the crossbar by Federici at full stretch, and a close-range shot by Aaron Ramsey, the Barclays Premier League side could not find a winner in normal time. In the end, an error from Australian Federici proved so costly, the keeper allowing a low, angled shot from Sanchez to slip through his legs and roll over the line on 115 minutes. 'It was a difficult game against a well organised, resilient, committed and physically strong Reading team,' Wenger said. 'They really wanted it Reading, they were willing to die on the pitch to go to the final and you have to congratulate them for the effort they put in. 'In the end, we were a bit lucky because their keeper made a mistake and I can understand that he is distraught, but as well he kept them in the game for long periods.' Wenger added: 'What was missing was a bit of speed of combination and sharpness in the final third maybe, but overall the concentration was there. Alexis Sanchez's low shot squirmed agonisingly through the legs of Reading goalkeeper Adam Federici in extra time . It was a routine shot from Sanchez but the Reading stopper failed to collect it properly in his grasp - an embarrassing gaffe . The ball rolled through his legs and slowly towards the goal line in the 106th minute of the game . Federici tries desperately to stop the ball going over the line after it rolled through his legs and out of his grasp . 'I don't think we switched off (for the goal), but after half-time we did not come on with the same intensity. We started to suffer and we paid for that.' Wenger refused to single out Szczesny for blame on the Reading goal. 'I would have to see it again,' he said. 'At first I thought it was not in because it took some time for the referee to give the goal, so I thought 'okay, we escaped'. Federici lies slumped on the ground as the impact of his error hits him in the FA Cup semi-final against Arsenal . 'But on slow motion maybe he goes back a bit to save the ball with his feet, then when the ball bounces, it was certainly over the line. 'We will have to analyse it, but the cross should not have come in and after the guy was free, so it was a combination of mistakes.' Wenger said an ankle injury to defender Per Mertesacker 'does not look good', which could make the German defender a doubt for Sunday's Barclays Premier League game against leaders Chelsea at the Emirates Stadium. The Reading goalkeeper, who had been magnificent until then, left the field in tears as manager Steve Clarke tries to console him . Arsenal reached a record 19th FA Cup final, and will be looking to overtake Manchester United's mark of 11 victories, with five coming under Wenger's tenure. 'Now, let's focus on our next game, we come back here in the final, but we have time to prepare,' Wenger said. 'The final is a 50-50 (game). If we can beat the record we will be very happy. 'Let's hope we have all of our players available and come back in good shape.' Federici's opposite number, Wojciech Szczesny (left) of Arsenal comforts his fellow goalkeeper after the game is resolved . Chelsea look in a strong position to go on and win the title, having defeated United 1-0 at Stamford Bridge on Saturday evening. Wenger said he was unaware of the final result when quizzed on its significance at the post-match press conference. 'I ignore completely what happened. Chelsea won 1-0? The usual,' the Arsenal boss said. 'We will see next week.'",Arsenal reached the FA Cup final despite failing to live up to recent form .

"It is one of the world's best loved musicals - the true story of a novice nun who falls in love with a widower and his seven children. From Julie Andrews waltzing through the Alps to seven children behaving perfectly,  The Sound of Music might look like it portrays the family everyone wants. But Andrews' real life counterpart - Maria Kutschera - was far from the idealized mother the popular film portrays. In fact she was a difficult Austrian woman plagued by insecurities. Scroll down for video . Maria Kutschera (centre) was far from the idealized mother The Sound of Music portrays, her son has revealed in a new book . Whereas Julie Andrews (above) waltzed carelessly through the Alps in the 1965 film, Maria was described by her son Johannes as 'incredibly strong' with 'literally an indomitable will' Her son Johannes has now revealed all in a new book written by Tom Santopietro. He said: 'She was  incredibly strong with a formidable will, literally an indomitable will. 'And sometimes running into that will was not so pleasant.' The 75-year-old added that his mother was very complex and admitted that she was unhappy as a child. Maria was born in 1905 while travelling from her parents' village in Tyrol to a hospital in Vienna, Austria, on a train. By the time she was ten both of her parents had died and she was sent to live with a violent uncle. Maria escaped from him and in 1926 she was a schoolteacher at the Nonnberg Abbey, in Salzburg, intending to become a nun. But while there she was asked to take a job as a governess at the home of a widowed man, who was left with seven children after his first wife Agatha died of scarlet fever. That man was Georg von Trapp. They would quickly become married and have three more children. Georg von Trapp was previously the commander of Austrian submarine U5. He is pictured with his fiancée Agathe Whitehead . The Von Trapp family are pictured in 1939. Top row: Werner and Rupert; Second row: Dr. Franz Wasner, Johanna, Martina, Maria and Georg, Johannes, Hedwig, Maria; Bottom: Agathe, Rosmarie and Eleonore . The family, including Andrews (centre), perform a song in the film. Rosmarie, one of Maria and Georg's children who does not feature in the film, said: 'We never went running in a field and singing songs like that' It was not long before Maria founded a family choir. Although the children sang together before she joined them, they remember her particularly pushing  public performances - especially after Georg lost his fortune. Rosmarie, one of Maria and Georg's children, often found her mother particularly difficult. She said it got worse after her father died in 1947. 'I was not happy on stage. I was made to do it,' Boudicca Fox-Leonard of the Sunday People reported her saying. The now 87-year-old said: 'We never went running in a field and singing songs like that. We had a hard life. It was a struggle.' In real life, after fleeing the country in 1938 the von Trapp's came to rely on their musical performances for money . She also recounts Maria sending her for shock therapy after she had a breakdown and said she locked step-daughter Johanna in a room for announcing she was getting married. After fleeing the country  in 1938, the family - known as the Trapp Family Singers in the US - came to rely on the performances for money. The popular film was made after Broadway found a book  detailing the family's adventurers. Maria later sold the rights  to Hollywood for £3,000. But director Robert Wise rebuffed her attempts to act as an adviser. He admitted in an interview: 'She was bossy, I didn't like that about her.' Even director Robert Wise rebuffed Maria's attempts to act as an adviser. He admitted in an interview: 'She was bossy, I didn't like that about her' Only three children, none of which feature in the film, survive. The last surviving von Trapp singer died in early 2014. Four of the couple's great-grandchildren are still attempting to keep the tradition alive. Sofi, Melanie, Amanda, and their younger brother August have revived the family's musical heritage and are singing together. They can remember little of their great-grandmother. Sofi said: 'We know she was a little impulsive, but without her the family would never have survived as a single group. 'The Captain would have been taken off to war if it wasn't for the singing.'

"Nearly 500 British holidaymakers were stranded overnight on an impounded cruise ship in Lisbon harbour after its owners were served with a summons for an allegedly unpaid debt. The passengers coming towards the end of a 15 night cruise became the unwitting pawns in a legal wrangle between a former crew member and the owners of the MV Azores. The ship had been set to leave Lisbon at 7pm on Tuesday night with its 489 passengers heading back to Bristol Avonmouth after a round-trip tour that took in La Coruna in Spain, the Azores, and Madeira. But that was scuppered when lawyers slapped a court order on the ship over an 'unresolved' and 'historic' financial wrangle. The harbour master then refused to let the ship leave for Bristol. Scroll down for video . Stranded: 489 British holidaymakers were stuck in Lisbon on the MV Azores (file photo) overnight after its owners were served with a summons for an allegedly unpaid debt . Stuck: They were due to leave Lisbon for Bristol at 7pm on Tuesday but lawyers slapped a court order on the ship over an 'unresolved' and 'historic' financial wrangle . The ship is operated by Essex-based Cruise & Maritime Voyages. But the legal dispute was between owners Portuscale Cruise - from which they were chartering the vessel - and one of that company's former staff. The UK cruise firm, which had nothing to do with the financial wrangle, eventually came to an arrangement with Portugese authorities which allowed the ship to sail - 19 hours late - at 2pm Wednesday. It said passengers were kept informed throughout, helped with onward travel arrangements affected by the delay, and given access to a complimentary bar. One stricken passenger sent a text to a relative telling him: 'Can't believe we're stuck in Lisbon, Portugal. 'Our ship has been impounded due to an historical incident which basically means an unpaid debt.' The Madeira-registered 16,144-tonne, 525ft-long MV Azores was built in 1946. It has eight passenger decks and room for 550 passengers in its 227 cabins. Prices for the cruise range from £779 per person for a standard twin inner-cabin, to £4,159 per person for the owner's suite with an ocean view. The average price for the majority of cabins is priced at £1,500 per person. Cruise & Maritime Voyages's commercial director Chris Coates said: 'The delay of the MV Azores overnight in Lisbon related to a historic local issue with the vessel's owning company, Portuscale Cruises from whom Cruise & Maritime Voyages charter the ship using our own crew. Wrangle: The legal dispute was between owners Portuscale Cruise - from which they were chartering the vessel (file photo) - and one of that company's former staff . Going nowhere: The harbour master then refused to let the ship leave the port and passengers eventually arrived back in the UK 19 hours late . 'This dispute involved a previous crewing issue going back to 2014 and was settled first thing this morning. 'But we had to wait for the clearance documentation to be signed off by the local authorities. The ship is now heading en-route back to the UK.' He added: 'On behalf of Cruise & Maritime Voyages, I would like to extend our sincere apologises for the delay and any disruption caused.' Coates said his company, set up in 2010, carries more than 100,000 ocean and river cruise passengers a year and had 'never experienced a delay of this nature before'. Luxurious: The average price for the majority of cabins on the MV Azores is priced at £1,500 per person . The firm's online brochure says of the MV Azores: 'With her handsome profile and a traditional walk around promenade deck, the 16,144grt Portuguese registered Azores is a classic beautifully restored ocean going cruise ship carrying just 550 guests and offers a wide selection of very well appointed and comfortable public lounges and cabin accommodation spanning eight passenger decks serviced by two lifts.' It features a choice of five comfortable lounges and bars including the Calypso main show lounge, plus a nightclub, cinema, casino, shopping boutique, photo shop, library, card and bridge room, fitness and health centre with sauna and massage facilities, an unheated outdoor swimming pool and a marbled reception area. Most cabins enjoy an ocean view and all the private en-suite cabins have a bath with shower, a hairdryer and personal safe, a TV for movies and news and information channels and a fridge with a mini bar facility.","Nearly 500 British holidaymakers were stranded on the MV Azores all night .

"Nigel Farage is a 'Victor Meldrew in stilts' whose remarks about immigrants and ethnic minorities reveal the 'truly odious nature of his views', Nick Clegg claimed today in an extraordinary attack on the UKIP leader. In an interview with MailOnline, Mr Clegg said Mr Farage's 'mask is slipping' to reveal a man uncomfortable talking about people who are not white 'lashing out' in a scrabble for headlines. The Lib Dem leader condemned David Cameron's appeal to UKIP supporters to 'come home', warning the 'bandwagons of the far right' are encircling an 'increasingly hapless Conservative leadership' which is losing all grip on the party. Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg claimed Nigel Farage's 'mask is slipping' to reveal a man uncomfortable talking about people who are not white 'lashing out' in a scrabble for headlines . Mr Cameron issued an appeal to people planning to vote UKIP to instead support the Tories in an attempt to block a 'toxic tie-up' between Laabiur and the SNP. But Mr Clegg condemned the 'worrying' suggestion that his former coalition partners should seek to build a majority by appealing to people on the 'far right'. Speaking in his bright yellow campaign bus as he headed to the South West, Mr Clegg: . Mr Farage has courted controversy throughout the election campaign, in an apparent attempt to generate headlines and shore up Ukip's core vote. He was condemned in the first TV leaders' debate for saying people with HIV should not be allowed into Britain and in the second for attacking the audience for being too left-wing. After criticism that the Ukip manifesto featured almost all white faces, he insisted yesterday that there was a 'half black' party spokesman featured prominently - and 'one fully black person'. The Lib Dem leader told MailOnline's political editor Matt Chorley that the 'bandwagons of the far right' are encircling an 'increasingly hapless Conservative leadership' Miriam González Durantezhas been writing a food blog . Nick Clegg is such a bad cook his wife Miriam only lets him do the washing up. The Lib Dem leader admitted his 'rubbishness' in the kitchen after it emerged his wife and sons had been secretly running a food blog - MumAndSons - posting recipes and photographs online. Mr Clegg said he had played no part in the culinary operation, but had helped with taking pictures for the blog: 'I'm sure you can see my hand in a couple of them.' But his own cooking abilities do not stretch to more than peanut butter on toast. 'I'm a sort of sous chef, Mr Clegg told MailOnline. 'I provide helpful moral backing and assistance. I'll do the washing up, and tasting and preparatory tasks.' Asked if there was nothing he could cook, Mr Clegg replied: 'I'm sure I could but I'm great eater, I'm just really not a very good cook. 'If I had to, if I was starving... Peanut butter on white toast obviously, with jam on top. I'm seriously into jam on top.' Ms Gonzalez Durantez said she had run a cooking blog with her children  for three years . Mr Clegg said the comments revealed Mr Farage's true nature: 'The mask is slipping. I think the more he thrashes around to get attention the more the mask slips and the truly odious nature of his views become more and more obvious. 'This is someone who is clearly uncomfortable talking about people from different ethnic backgrounds, calls them 'half' and 'fully' black, but is also someone who advocates basically turning our backs on people who are very sick and kind of indulging in a language that is so divisive, so odious.' Mr Clegg, who boasts that the Lib Dems will win many, many more seats than UKIP on May 7, accused Mr Farage of 'running a truly incompetent campaign'. 'He is just lashing around, thrashing around, lurching from one odious gaffe or assertion to the next. There is no pattern. 'One moment he claims he wants to take his manifesto seriously and the next he is talking about fully and half black candidates. 'You are either serious or a kind of Victor Meldrew on stilts. Which one are you? 'It just beggars belief that it is that kind of person that the Conservative party thinks they need to bring back into the fold.' He said Mr Cameron's appeal to Ukip voters 'could not have been more explicit - people like Farage, please come back home'. 'I don't think the Conservative should have a home for those kind of views,' he added. Mr Clegg, who visited the Airbus HQ in Filton, Bristol before travelling to Wales, said he would use the final 15 days of the campaign to tell voters of the 'danger of these kind of really odious views basically taking over or encroaching upon how a mainstream party like the Conservative party thinks and acts'. He warned that without the Lib Dems back in coalition, the Tories would be dragged to the 'extremes' by right wing backbenchers, Ukip and the DUP. He said that it is a 'tragedy' that a centrist politician like Mr Cameron had lost control of his party. 'What's happening is you are seeing the bandwagons of the far right encircling an increasingly hapless Conservative leadership. 'And the Conservative leadership will become just victim to and puppets of an array of hardline right wing voices from UKip, from DUP, from their own backbenches, which will do huge damage to our country. Huge damage. Mr Clegg, who visited the Airbus factory in Filton, Bristol today, said the Lib Dems would act as a 'bulwark' against the Tories lurching to the right . Mr Clegg claimed right wing Tories want to 'enter into coalition with Ukip, some of them want to bring back the death penalty, they want to ban the burka' Mr Farage - appearing on ITV's Lorraine this morning - has courted controversy throughout the election campaign, sparking accusations from Mr Clegg today that he was an 'odious Victor Meldrew' (pictured right) Mr Clegg claimed right wing Tories want to 'enter into coalition with Ukip, some of them want to bring back the death penalty, they want to ban the burka'. 'They have got very hardline views on people who need help from the state because they have fallen on hard times,' Mr Clegg said. 'And they take this very ideological view that basically the state and support for public services should be remorselessly cut back and cut back and cut back and cut back for no reason other than some kind of hardline ideological preference for it.' Mr Clegg went head to head with Mr Farage in two TV debates last year, ahead of the European Parliament elections, which UKip went on to win while the Lib Dems lost all but one seat in Brussels. Mr Clegg insisted most people in Britain are 'decent and pragmatic', and that the Lib Dems are most 'in tune' with public opinion. But he admitted he faces a 'challenge' to turn that into votes after a devastating collapse in popularity since entering coalition five years ago. We're the guarantee that will not let the swivel-eyed brigade take over. He added: 'We are the only bulwark, we are the only barrier, we are the only dam against this increasing pressure from people with some very, very nasty views which would lead to ideologically imposed cuts on nurseries, on schools on colleges.' David Cameron came under fire from Mr Clegg as he visited Advantage children's daycare nursery in Surbiton with London Mayor Boris Johnson . Mr Clegg said he defended Mr Farage's right to say controversial things in an open democracy, but hoped they would be defeated on Election Day. 'I really really abhor what Farage stands for but I don't begrudge the right to say what he says and seek to represent those views in Parliament. 'What worries me much more is not whether he gets a number of MPs in the House of Commons, those seats then become the tail that wags the Tory dog. 'Democracy should be able to encompass views that I would find absolutely beyond the pale, that's what being a free country is about. 'It's about disagreeing with those views, taking them on, arguing against them and defeating them in an argument. 'It's not about saying they shouldn't be expressed. That would be very illiberal.' A Ukip spokesman said: 'This smacks of desperation from a Clegg, horrified by his disastrous polls, trying to punch above his weight. If only he'd do it with policy, rather than these venting, personal attacks. A trick he has obviously learned from Mr Cameron.'","EXCLUSIVE Nick Clegg warns the Ukip leader's 'mask is slipping' Condemns Farage for comments on migrants and 'half black' candidates .

"First-time parents Kate and David Ogg were heartbroken when they were told one of their twins - born two minutes apart at just 26 weeks - had stopped breathing and had just moments to live. Thinking it was the only time they would have with the tiny boy they had already decided to name Jamie, Kate asked to be able to hold the lifeless child, and told David to climb into the hospital bed for a tender embrace. What happened next was nothing short of a miracle. Scroll down for video . When Kate and David Ogg were told their newborn son Jamie had passed away on March 25, 2010, they took him in their arms and cradled him to keep him warm . Jamie and Emily are now about to turn five years old and their parents have only recently told them of the miraculous story . In this mother's loving arms, the little boy started moving, and his breathing grew stronger. Hospital staff rushed back to his aid and together brought the baby back to life. Five years on, Jamie Ogg is a healthy, happy kid whose biggest problem regarding his troubled entry in the world is having a little brother who tells anyone who'll listen that he used to be dead but now he's alive. After years of trying to fall pregnant, the Queensland couple were delighted to find out they were having twins - the 'pigeon pair' of a boy and girl. But just six months into the pregnancy they found themselves in the delivery room and facing premature births. Jamie was born first on March 25, 2010 and his sister Emily followed two minutes later. 'They were both born in their sac but Jamie didn't make a noise when they tore it open. Emily let out a big wail,' Ms Ogg told Daily Mail Australia. 'We looked over and everyone was crowding around Jamie - there was about 20 people in the room. The vibe wasn't very good. When they were told the devastating news, Kate ordered her husband to take off his shirt and get into the bed to provide extra warmth - and miraculously he gasped for air and opened his eyes . Doctors worked on Jamie for 20 minutes before they stopped and informed his heartbroken parents . The doctor sat on the end of Ms Ogg's hospital bed and asked the couple if they had a name picked out . After birth, skin-to-skin contact is recognised as a simple step mothers can take to welcome their baby into the world. For Kate and David Ogg the point is all the more pertinent. The birth process is a stressful and exhausting time for the baby. Unicef advises mothers to hold their child in skin-to-skin contact to help their baby 'adapt to their new environment'. It means their 'heartbeat and breathing will be better controlled' and there is a wealth of evidence that suggests babies held in skin-to-skin contact are less stressed by the birth process. Unicef's advice states: 'We know that babies who have spent an hour in skin contact are significantly less stressed after the birth experience - this means their breathing and heart rate are more stable, they cry less, and when they start to feed, they digest their food better. 'A mother's chest area is significantly warmer than other parts of her body - ready to welcome her new baby and prevent them from cooling down - which is a significant risk. 'Your baby has been lovely and warm in your uterus - at around 37 degrees, whereas the labour room will be significantly cooler, and he is wet – it’s like getting out of the swimming baths, you need to get dry and warm quickly.' Meanwhile Caroline Davey, chief executive of the premature baby charity, Bliss, echoed the importance of skin-to-skin contact. She said it is 'an essential part of family-centred care and should be part of the care that all babies receive'. Ms Davey added: 'Evidence shows that it can help to regulate the baby’s heartbeat, lower their stress levels and can play an important role in improving the positive outcomes for premature babies.’ 'He stopped breathing and his heartbeat was nearly gone. After 20 minutes they stopped working on him.' The doctor sat on the end of Ms Ogg's hospital bed and asked the couple if they had a name picked out. He then informed them that there was nothing more they could do to save Jamie. 'I saw him gasp but the doctor said it was no use. I took Jamie off the doctor, asked everyone to leave. He was cold and I just wanted him to be warm,' she said. 'We had tried for years to have kids and I felt so guilty. I just wanted to cuddle him. I unwrapped him and ordered my husband to take his shirt off and climb into the bed. 'I know it sounds stupid, but if he was still gasping there was still a sign of life so I wasn't going to give up easily. 'I know it sounds stupid, but if he was still gasping there was still a sign of life so I wasn't going to give up easily,' Mrs Ogg said . 'We were trying to entice him to stay. We explained his name and that he had a twin that he had to look out for and how hard we tried to have him,' Mrs Ogg said . 'He suddenly gasped... then he opened his eyes. He was breathing and grabbing Dave's finger,' Mrs Ogg said . 'We were trying to entice him to stay. We explained his name and that he had a twin that he had to look out for and how hard we tried to have him. 'He suddenly gasped... then he opened his eyes. He was breathing and grabbing Dave's finger. 'If we had let the doctor walk out of the room with him, Jamie would have been dead.' Jamie and Emily are now about to turn five years old and their parents have only recently told them of the miraculous story. 'Emily burst into tears, she was really upset and she kept hugging Jamie,' Ms Ogg said. 'They love to talk about when they were babies. 'They have a little brother Charlie who loves telling anyone who listens. He'll say: ""When I was born I was fat and the twins were skinny. Jamie was also dead but now he is alive"".' Emily and Jamie also have a little brother Charlie, 4, and regularly talk about their miracle birth story . Remarkably, Jamie has not encountered one medical problem in the five years since his birth . When the twins were first told of their miracle birth, Emily burst into tears and wouldn't stop hugging Jamie . The Ogg family have set up an online community called Jamie's Gift to regularly raise funds for the Miracle Babies Foundation - an organisation that supports premature and sick newborns . Remarkably, Jamie has not encountered one medical problem in the five years since his birth. 'He is absolutely fine... the biggest concern they had was cerebral palsy because of the lack of oxygen but there's been nothing,' Ms Ogg said. 'It's absolutely astounding. This whole experience makes you cherish them more.' The Ogg family have set up an online community called Jamie's Gift to regularly raise funds for the Miracle Babies Foundation - an organisation that supports premature and sick newborns. Dave is currently training for an Ironman triathlon in Port Macquarie in May to raise funds. 'He will put his body through a gruelling 3.8km swim, 180km bike and a marathon,' Ms Ogg said.

"The 16-year-old girl who survived a deadly axe-attack that claimed the lives of three family members has been released from hospital after suffering severe brain damage and a severed jugular. Marli van Breda has been transferred to a rehabilitation clinic after leaving Vergelegen Medi-Clinic in Somerset West, just outside of Cape Town, on Tuesday, News24 reports. The former Perth schoolgirl has been in hospital since she was struck several times on the head and had her throat slashed in her family's South African home on January 27. Scroll down for video . Marli van Breda, 16, suffered severe brain damage when she was struck several times on the head in her family's South African home in January . Henri van Breda (back left) escaped the attack while his father Martin, 55 (back right), mother Teresa, 54 (front right), and brother Rudi, 22 (back centre) were killed. Marli, 16 (front left), suffered severe head and throat injuries . The attack claimed the lives of her mother Teresa, 54, father Martin, 55, and older brother Rudi, 22. Marli's other brother Henri, 20, escaped with light injuries and rang police to report the deaths at the Stellenbosch home, east of Cape Town. Family spokesman Martin Coetzee said Marli will undergo occupational and physical therapy at the rehabilitation clinic after six weeks in hospital. While her health has improved, Marli has not yet been able to make a complete police statement regarding the attack. She has been able to talk despite her injuries, but not for long periods. The family have not revealed the rehabilitation centre where Marli will be treated so her recovery can go ahead without disruptions. Chilling: An audio recording between Henri (right, pictured with brother Rudi) and emergency services after his family were hacked to death with an axe, revealed the 20-year-old appeared to giggle during the call . Marli was transferred to a rehabilitation clinic on Tuesday after spending six weeks at Vergelegen Medi-Clinic in Somerset West, just outside of Cape Town . It comes after reports last month that visitors had been banned from visiting the teenager's hospital room in a bid to keep her surviving brother away. 'They fear she might go into shock, or will be traumatised further if she sees him,' a source told  The Sunday Times newspaper. Marli has reportedly been crying when she sees photos of her parents and brother. 'It is heartbreaking to see tears rolling down her cheeks,' a person close to the family said. It emerged last month that an audio recording of the emergency phone call made by Henri, obtained by eNews Channel Africa, seems to reveal him 'giggling' as he explains the details of the bloody massacre. 'What kind of injuries are there?' a woman can be heard asking Henri, who responds: 'my family and me were attacked by a guy with an axe.' When asked if they were unconscious, he responded, 'yes, and bleeding from the head', before what sounds like a faint chuckle is heard. A cleaner who worked for one of the van Breda's neighbours saw the young man, covered in blood, using his phone outside the house shortly after the attack. Deceased: Martin (left) and wife Theresa (right) both died at their home in Stellenbosch -  east of Cape Town . Rudi (pictured left and right) has been remembered by friends as a keen sportsman. His younger brother Henri is currently living with his uncle Her after suffering light injuries . The van Breda family had just moved back to South Africa in June after six years in Perth, Western Australia . The young man's mental health has been under scrutiny since News24 reported he had undergone brain scans at an Australian hospital in 2014. However the results were negative and no further testing occurred. A doctor who examined the young man following the attack revealed his injuries were self-inflicted. He was also reportedly addicted to tik and his allowance was cut off before his family were attacked. Henri has been living with his uncle, Her Breda, since the attack and has been receiving counselling. His uncle denied rumours the police wanted to keep him away from a private memorial service held for his deceased family - insisting he was simply being hidden from the media's gaze. Popular: Rudi Van Breda was popular with his friends at Trinity College and the University of Melbourne . Separated siblings: Rudi (left) was killed during the attack, while Marli (right) remains in a critical but stable condition in a South African hospital . A close family friend described the van Breda's as 'like a perfect family' 'For obvious reasons Henri is very heartbroken, and we will support him as the family,' he was quoted in The Times. 'We as a family are here for him, we will not disappoint him... I promise Henri I won't drop him.' No one has been charged over the attack on the family and Marli has a round-the-clock police guard. The family were based in Perth and the Sunshine Coast in Australia, before returning to South Africa in mid-2014.

"(CNN)It recalled one of the most memorable moments in comic book history, but for critics on social media, one comic book cover went too far, and it's now been pulled. DC Comics pulled the cover for the upcoming ""Batgirl"" #41, which portrays the Joker threatening a frightened Batgirl with a gun, with ""Joker makeup"" on her mouth. The Twitter hashtag #changethecover had been trending since Friday, when the cover was revealed. It's a variant, aka an optional cover, which tends to grab the attention of collectors but won't be the main cover seen in most stores. For the month of June, DC's variant covers are celebrating the 75th anniversary of the iconic villain. The cover recalls Barbara ""Batgirl"" Gordon's encounter with the Joker in the classic story ""The Killing Joke."" In it, he brutally attacked Barbara, kidnapping her, and it was heavily implied that she was sexually assaulted. After being shot, the character remained in a wheelchair for decades, until DC retconned Barbara's fate in 2011, allowing her to walk again and be Batgirl. The criticism of the cover spread over a few days, though others defended it with their own hashtags. DC Comics (owned by Time Warner, which also owns CNN) said in a statement late Monday that artist Rafael Albuquerque's cover was going to be pulled. ""Regardless if fans like Rafael Albuquerque's homage to Alan Moore's THE KILLING JOKE graphic novel from 25 years ago, or find it inconsistent with the current tonality of the Batgirl books -- threats of violence and harassment are wrong and have no place in comics or society,"" they said. ""We stand by our creative talent, and per Rafael's request, DC Comics will not publish the Batgirl variant. "" Albuquerque said in his own statement, ""My Batgirl variant cover artwork was designed to pay homage to a comic that I really admire, and I know is a favorite of many readers. 'The Killing Joke' is part of Batgirl's canon and artistically, I couldn't avoid portraying the traumatic relationship between Barbara Gordon and the Joker."" He continued, ""For me, it was just a creepy cover that brought up something from the character's past that I was able to interpret artistically. But it has become clear, that for others, it touched a very important nerve. I respect these opinions and, despite whether the discussion is right or wrong, no opinion should be discredited. He concluded, ""My intention was never to hurt or upset anyone through my art. For that reason, I have recommended to DC that the variant cover be pulled. I'm incredibly pleased that DC Comics is listening to my concerns and will not be publishing the cover art in June as previously announced."" Albuquerque added in a tweet on Monday night that he was never threatened (the ""threats"" DC referenced were aimed at those objecting to the cover, per ""Batgirl"" writer Cameron Stewart). Stewart tweeted more: ""I stand behind Rafael as an artist and a friend, and think he made the right decision. The cover was not seen or approved by anyone on Team Batgirl and was completely at odds with what we are doing with the comic. So, we have the creators of the book and the artist himself all agreeing that the cover was inappropriate. There's no 'censorship' here."" That didn't stop the controversy on social media. It was just the latest brouhaha involving portrayals of women in comic books and variant covers in particular. In September, Marvel Comics canceled future variant covers from artist Milo Manara after a ""Spider-Woman"" No. 1 variant cover caused an uproar for being ""over-sexualized."" (The company later said there was no connection between the two events.)","Comic book portraying character with Joker makeup and gun to her head has stirred controversy .

"Travelling can be tiring, especially if there are many flights involved and jet lag. However for one sleepy explorer, a trip of a lifetime to witness the Amazon Rainforest seemed to be all too much - that or he was completely uninterested in the adventurous trips he was booked on. Redditor Roxambops, aka Roxy de la Rosa posted the pictures of dozing Alex Elenes on the social networking site this week with the caption: ‘Went to the Amazon, cousin slept everywhere.’ Meet Alex Elenes. The traveller went on a trip of a lifetime to see the Amazon rainforest...but he missed the whole thing being asleep! Dozing away! Even a  trip piranha fishing could not stir the slumberer from his nap . Incredible nature moments the traveller missed due to napping include a pink dolphin watching tour and even a nail-biting piranha fishing expedition. Sadly he even missed seeing adorable sloths and monkeys in the wild, and impressive giant Amazon lily pads. When action was required of him, and he was due to take an intrepid jungle hike, naturally he slept through his alarm and missed the whole thing. The pictures were captured by his cousin Roxy de la Rosa who posted them on Reddit . Cousin Roxy said that her slumbering companion had been the one to push for the trip and that he chose the trip over going to Machu Picchu since he was set on seeing the jungle. The bemused San Diego said: ‘He had no real reason to keep falling asleep; he also slept any time we we were in our room. ‘Our trip was to Iquitos, Peru, for a few days at the end of February, and cost around £1,000 ($1,600) just for the Amazon addition.’ The sleeper had pushed for the trip, and said he was keen to see the Amazon rainforest in particular as he had already been to Machu Picchu, the alternative trip . Alex is said to be bemused at his new found internet fame, following the pictures going viral on the site. Roxy said: ‘He’s surprised anyone else thinks it’s funny besides us. ‘My favourite thing is that his biggest fear is falling out of a moving car while sleeping, yet he was fine napping on a tiny boat in the giant Amazon river.’ Expensive sleep! The trip cost Alex upwards of £1,000 ($1,600) and he even missed getting up for the jungle trek completely .","Alex Elenes persuaded his cousin to go to the Amazon over Machu Picchu .

"A married couple who were so desperate to be parents they sold all their valuables to fund costly fertility treatment finally have the baby of their dreams - after winning a competition. Chris and Amanda Schlatter, from Nevada, had tried unsuccessfully for 12 years to fall pregnant, attempting to conceive naturally - even experimenting with fertility-boosting yoga hanging upside down after intercourse. But after finding themselves broke after almost a decade of unsuccessful attempts, the pair ended up winning the chance to have a baby in a competition run by an IVF charity - and this week celebrate the second birthday of their son Noah. Chris and Amanda Schlatter, from Nevada, celebrate their son Noah's 2nd birthday this week . Noah, pictured newborn, was conceived after Chris wrote a heartfelt plea to the charity Babyquest explaining the couples years of fertility struggles . After starting to after visiting a fertility clinic in December 2009, tests found Mr Schlatter had low testosterone levels and Mrs Schlatter was diagnosed with endometriosis, a polycystic ovary and a blocked fallopian tube. The couple started IUI – intrauterine insemination – which involves separating out the fastest moving sperm and placing them in the womb. But the costly treatment meant they were forced to sell possessions in their home to cover the $10,000 (£6000) cost. 'We became so desperate to get pregnant we sold everything of value in our home, to fund the IUI,' Mrs Schlatter, 30, said. Amanda and Chris on their wedding day: 'When I married my wife my intention was to give her the world, but instead we have known struggle' Chris said in his prize-winning letter . Left: The couple when they first met; Right: Pictured recently with Noah as he turns two . 'With each treatment I hoped we'd get pregnant. And when each one failed we'd pin our hopes on the next. But we had six goes and none of them were successful. 'My wife and I have seen hardships but none greater than what we currently face. 'In the first months of our relationship Amanda and I would sit and talk for hours about our future children. 'Our initial failures did not alarm us, our panic did not begin until we'd been trying several years. 'We understood conceiving a baby can sometimes take more time for some than others. We needed to try harder but nothing worked. 'After several failed attempts the heartbreak became more intense. 'When I married my wife my intention was to give her the world, but instead we have known struggle. 'As we read about your [the charity's] work, our hopes began to rise to know there are organisations that still exist to help people and ease the pain of others. 'The pain of infertility is brutal and the tears have been frequent. With your [the charity's] help, those tears can finally be dried.' 'I felt bitter that other people had children and felt sad and jealous when friends started having babies. 'In the end our doctor said: ""Any further treatment along these lines would be a waste of money""'. 'IVF became our only option after this, but we knew it would be expensive, and we'd run out of things to sell by this point.' Amazingly, it was Mr Schlatter's magical words that saw them get pregnant after they beat 99 other couples to win funding for IVF treatment. After researching treatment options online, the couple came across a charity, Baby Quest Foundation, which was granting struggling couples the funding for IVF. So Mr Schlatter, 34, applied, explaining why he and his wife would make perfect parents, and should receive the help. 'His letter was so heartfelt,' Mrs Schlatter explained. 'He wrote about our struggle to conceive and about how heart-breaking it had been for us with every negative pregnancy test.' Incredibly, two months later, in April 2012, the couple got the call to say they'd won the funding. And less than a year later, in March 2013, their son Noah was born. Mrs Schlatter said: 'When the doctor said the words I never thought I'd hear – 'you're pregnant' I couldn't stop smiling. 'After eight years of trying we were finally going to have a family of our own – thanks to Chris' beautiful words. Left: Miracle baby Noah pictured recently; Right: A newborn Noah in March 2013 . Mrs Schlatter (pictured when she was pregnant in 2013) said: 'When the doctor said the words I never thought I'd hear – 'you're pregnant' I couldn't stop smiling. 'Chris and I had first spoken about having kids a year after we met when I was 18 and he was 22. We were young, but all we ever wanted to be was parents.' Speaking of her struggle to fall pregnant naturally, Mrs Schlatter continued: 'It just didn't happen naturally for us. So we tried natural treatments. I took vitamins and did yoga to boost my fertility. 'I even hung upside down, any stupid thing that was suggested, to get me pregnant. 'We tried not to worry, but as our friends started having families we couldn't help it. 'Our sex life became like a military operation. Each day I'd take my temperature, and work out which day of the month I'd be most fertile. Then we'd take time off work specifically to try and conceive. 'Having sex stopped being romantic. It was like a chore and not fun.' Mrs Schlatter said of Noah (pictured recently): 'We have nothing but thanks for the charity who've made our family possible. Noah is our miracle baby' Mrs Schlatter, pictured  pregnant, is due to start the process of trying to get pregnant again, with the embryos created during their winning IVF treatment . During their plight to be parents, Mrs Schlatter admits convincing herself that she was pregnant every time her period was late, and whenever she had an ache or pain, she put it down to a symptom of pregnancy. The mum-of-one, said: 'Every month another test would be negative and I'd make excuses, like I'd tested too early, and try again. 'We did hundreds of tests and they were always negative. It seemed like the one thing I wanted I couldn't have. I was ashamed that I couldn't do what a woman is supposed to do, or give my husband what he wanted.' The couple, who celebrate Noah's 2nd birthday this week, are due to start the process of trying to get pregnant again, with the embryos created during their winning IVF treatment. Mrs Schlatter added: 'We have nothing but thanks for the charity who've made our family possible. Noah is our miracle baby, and we hope now to give him a brother or sister. 'Without winning that treatment, Chris and I would still be struggling to have a baby and still going through all that heartache. We really couldn't be more thrilled that we won. Noah is by far the best prize we could've hoped for.' The mum-of-one, said: 'Every month another test would be negative and I'd make excuses, like I'd tested too early, and try again.

"A Saudi Arabian citizen has captured intense footage of a sandstorm sweeping its way across a street, engulfing everything in its path. Sandstorms caused havoc in Saudi Arabia last week with a number of flights being cancelled and schools being forced to close. Car crashes were also reported in other areas as parts of the Arabian Peninsula   were plunged into darkness. Strong winds are believed to have caused the disruption, which resulted in nearby Dubai’s skyline almost disappearing and people suffering from respiratory problems. The footage, captured on camera in Saudi Arabia by Mohammed Mohsen, shows the sandstorm sweeping into the area in which he stands at a staggering speed. Like the aftermath of an explosion, the orange cloud engulfs the road and nearby buildings while it continues to move forward. Mohammed Mohsen captures the orange cloud getting thicker as it disperses and engulfs the road . The orange cloud gets thicker and drastically reduces visibility across the entire Arab state . Getting thicker, the cloud suddenly becomes darker and is it disperses further  sunlight becomes drastically reduced. A number of people stand alongside the video maker, staring in awe and filming the large cloud on their own camera phones. The video concludes with the filmmaker moving the camera around to show the sheer capacity of the cloud, which he is now very much encapsulated within. Mohammed Mohsen films the cloud above his head and captures the moment he becomes engulfed within it . Last week the storm filled Saudi Arabia’s air before spreading across the peninsula into the United Arab Emirates, Oman and Yemen. Despite sandstorms being a relatively common occurrence in this part of the world, they are not generally this big and rarely wreak so much havoc. Many people took to social media to upload the images they had taken of the sandstorm and share their experiences.",Citizen captured sandstorm sweeping its way through part of the state .

"(CNN)Hillary Clinton held a closed door meeting with President Barack Obama at the White House on Monday.  Although the former secretary of state, senator and first lady has not declared, it is treated as a foregone conclusion that Clinton is running for president. Likely to launch her campaign in April, Clinton is regarded as the front-runner — if not the only Democratic candidate — and the inevitable Democratic nominee. There is an assumption that since Clinton supported Obama, the black community will now embrace her.  But there are more than a few who didn't get that memo.  At this stage of the game, many African-Americans may not be excited about a candidate Hillary Clinton in 2016. And after two terms of the nation's first black president, she should proceed with caution. Clinton need look no further than the 2008 contest, when black voters doused water on her presidential prospects.  Early on, Clinton was the favorite of black folks, lest you forgot, and it did not hurt that President Clinton had been regarded as the ""first black president"" with high approval among African-Americans. Then, support for a senator named Barack Obama blew up after the Iowa caucuses. And Clinton found herself apologizing for her husband's comments about Obama's win in the South Carolina primary. President Clinton was relieved of his black card privileges for the remainder of the 2008 election season when he compared Obama's win in the Palmetto state to that of Jesse Jackson in 2004 and 2008, suggesting that Obama, like Jackson, would not win.  The misstep was an affront to many African-Americans, as were Hillary Clinton's suggestions on the campaign trail that Obama was only good for making speeches, but not for taking action. And let's not forget her assertions that she was the candidate for ""hard-working Americans, white Americans."" We can chalk up some of that rhetoric to spirited campaign-trail junk-talking, and obviously much has happened since the 2008 election.  President Obama made Clinton his secretary of state, and she served as a capable top diplomat and a loyal member of the Obama Cabinet.  But that does not mean black voters will completely forget the bitter, racially tinged presidential campaign politics of seven years ago. Black voters are among the most loyal of the Democratic Party base, and their record high turnout for Obama  was an important part of his victory.  However, with a charismatic Obama no longer on the ballot, maintaining the same level of enthusiasm for any other candidate is a challenge. theGrio.com: Blacks are treated 72% as well as whites . Moreover, as for Clinton, who (understandably?) has her own ideas and may not agree with the President on certain issues, any criticism of Obama could cost her some black voters.  Remember that Clinton voted in favor of the unpopular, costly and deadly Iraq war.  That support cost Clinton in 2008.  And while she has remained silent on the recent re-election of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Clinton's strongly pro-Israel stance on Mideast peace now appears at odds with the emerging consensus among major groups in the Democratic base, including blacks, Latinos and young voters. However, it is likely that foreign policy will not pose as great a challenge to Hillary Clinton as economics.  Because she is tied to the Wall Street wing of her party and commands sky-high speaking fees, people may take a closer look at her approach to tackling inequality and the shrinking of the middle class, and whether she is too concerned about offending the wealthy. The nation is hurting, despite the economic turnaround, and this is felt particularly strongly among blacks, who still have high unemployment rates, a rising wealth gap compared to whites, and, for many, no recovery in sight. And while police shootings of young black men continue to stir outrage in the community, Clinton has remained relatively quiet on the subject. She will have to prove that she can identify with this frustration and offer ideas for reform in local law enforcement. This, rather than her email account, is what concerns the black electorate. theGrio.com: Let's stop the 'struggle equation' Perhaps a populist, more down-to-earth challenger such as Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren or former Virginia Sen. Jim Webb could appeal to black and working-class voters, and unlike Clinton, would not have to fight the perception of living in a protective security bubble, or lacking core beliefs other than being in power. It is safe to assume that if Clinton wins the Democratic nomination that she will ultimately win the majority black vote in the general election, but that may not be enough. Let's remember President George W. Bush won re-election in 2004 with just 11% of the black vote. Had Mitt Romney been able to duplicate that number of black votes, he would be president now. Obama won in no small part because blacks turned out for him in record numbers in 2012, particularly in swing states like Ohio. Clinton can't assume she'll inherit that same level of black voter enthusiasm.  Support for Barack Obama does not necessarily translate into support for another Democrat.  This means Clinton must fight for votes like anyone else: knock on doors, kiss babies, clap off beat at the AME church, and do whatever it takes.","David Love: The former secretary of state would need to woo African-American voters to turn out in big numbers for 2016 . Memories of the bitter 2008 battle with Barack Obama still linger, he writes .",d5e1b544a5b7953fc883bad13bac30d8391c8d2a
"A South Australian man holidaying in Vanuatu reportedly survived on a diet of flying fox and small native birds after bunking down with locals in the aftermath of Cyclone Pam. Three days before the category five cyclone hit 45–year-old Andrew Brooks travelled south to Tanna Island in the hopes he could climb the active Yasur volcano. The thrill seeker got more than he bargained for as the powerful cyclone hit in the early hours of the morning killing 16 people across the nation and demolishing almost everything in its path. Scroll down for video . The category five cyclone ravaged small villages completely wiping out the grass huts the villagers call home . Mr Brooks, along with 60 villagers and a score of tourists, sought refuge in a concrete school building and waited for the howling wind to stop. He sat huddled with the villagers for four or five hours while the cyclone tore through, destroying the grass huts that made up the village. He told The Advertiser the wind was incredibly loud, almost like a ‘freight train or jet plane.’ Mr Brooks waited for aid with around 60 villagers at the foot of Yasur volcano after Cyclone Pam hit . After the winds stopped Mr Brooks soon realised he was stranded and spent the next five days cut off from civilisation at the foot of the volcano. It was at this stage the villagers discovered that all the gardens and cooking houses were destroyed by the sheer force of the winds. He said they managed to find some rice vegetables and chicken which sustained them for a day or two before he was gobsmacked by what he was served next. After running out of food villagers offered Mr Brooks flying fox which he said was nice, but tough . Mr Brooks was in the southern region of Vanuatu when Cyclone Pam hit . He was presented with a cooked flying fox but knowing food was limited Mr Brooks said he was in no position to turn his nose up to warm meat . He said the resourceful villagers fashioned missiles from lengths of wood to strike down unsuspecting birds and bats. “Any time anything flew past, whether it was a finch or a flying fox, there’d be this hail of sticks thrown at it,” he told reporters. “They were getting finches and baby pigeons and eating them. And one morning they got a flying fox, which is quite large, and they cooked it up with rice and gave me a serve and they ate the rest. Villagers fashioned missiles from lengths of wood to strike down unsuspecting small birds and bats . He didn’t complain about his interesting diet and said it was ‘quite tasty’ but tough, likening the flavours to that of chicken. Although he was happy not to be starving he said he had concerns about the villagers health and safety after the cyclone left them with nothing. “There are lots of young babies in the area and they were saying, ‘Our babies are going to die and the old people are going to die’, because it’s so remote and they’re at the end of the road so they’re going to be the last to get aid, probably,” he said. He reported that villagers were having to hike 4 kilometers up mountains to get fresh water. Mr Brooks said villagers were concerned about the large population of young children on the island . Mr Brooks is worried the villagers will have trouble bouncing back from the disaster, adding that he hopes aid reaches the ‘far-flung villages’ like the one that sheltered him. Although no one he was with sustained injuries, people in nearby villages weren’t so lucky with a mother and son perishing after they were struck with debris. Mr Brooks said he intended to return to Vanuatu in the ­future to thank the villagers who sheltered and fed him. These revelations came as Foreign Minister Julie Bishop pledged Australia’s long term support for Vanuatu during a visit to the Pacific nation. 'The Australian government and the Australian people will continue to support you in your time of need' Accompanied by the Chief of the Defence Force, Air Chief Marshal Mark Binskin, she strongly indicated that Australia would make a substantial contribution to the longer term rebuilding of the devastated nation. ""Prime Minister I want to assure you that the Australian government and the Australian people will continue to support you in your time of need, not only in the immediate aftermath of the cyclone, but I know that your long term recovery efforts will take some time."" Ms Bishop arrived Sunday morning to tour the cyclone relief centre in the capital Port Vila. She said Australia has sent over 11 military planes carrying lifesaving supplies and humanitarian support personnel.","Andrew Brooks, 45, was holidaying in Vanuatu when Cyclone Pam hit .

"It looks like any other anonymous office building. But this nondescript garage in Sunnyvale, California, is where Apple is believed to be building its self driving 'Titan' cars. One blog claims the address is the HQ for the project which could one day take on Tesla. Scroll down for video . This office complex is believed to be home to Apple's secret car project. The building is advertised as home to a mysterious company named SixtyEight Research. Claims that Apple is building a car may seem like a leap, but it isn't the first time such projects have been discussed by the Californian firm. In an interview last year, Apple board member Mickey Drexler said that before his death in 2011 Steve Jobs had considered building a car. He told Paul Goldberger: 'Steve Jobs was gonna design an iCar. 'I think cars have an extraordinary opportunity for cool design.' 'Two people with knowledge of the project say Apple has been working on it and receiving shipments related to its development at a building just minutes from 1 Infinite Loop, in the town of Sunnyvale,' wrote AppleInsider. 'We can confirm that Apple does indeed have a large presence at the location, and that numerous automotive-related renovations, including an 'auto work area' and a 'repair garage,' have been constructed on the premises.' The building is advertised as home to a mysterious company named SixtyEight Research. Aside from a sparse website registered through GoDaddy less than a year ago that reveals virtually no information about the company, SixtyEight has no discernible online presence. 'We are experts in market research; helping companies find the relevant market data and industry analysis required to make informed decisions,' its site says. The building is apparently known as SG5 within Apple, and issues visitor passes identical to Apple's - minus the logo. Apple could have an electric car ready to go on sale by 2020, putting it in direct competition with rivals Tesla Motors and General Motors, according to an industry expert. Evidence is mounting that the tech giant is gearing up to revolutionise the automobile market, just as it did with smartphones and tablets. Images taken over the past few weeks have shown a prototype car that suggests Apple is testing the water - ahead of a release in as little as five years. When AppleInsider visited SixtyEight's headquarters at building '175' earlier this week, its windows were a 'frosted' opaque, and security cameras were visible outside. Bloomberg has claimed that Apple could have a car ready by 2020, based on images of a test car. After the first mysterious camera-mounted car was spotted in California last week, further sightings of Apple's minivans have been posted online, with equipment on top (shown here) According to Tim Higgins from Bloomberg, automakers 'typically spend five to seven years developing a car'. And a 2020 timeframe would underscore Apple's 'aggressive goals and could set the stage for a battle for customers with Tesla Motors Inc and General Motors Co.' Both of those are planning to release a sub-£26,000 ($40,000) electric car in 2017 that can travel more than 200 miles (320km) on a single charge. Steve LeVine, author of 'The Powerhouse,' a book about the automotive battery industry, said on Bloomberg TV Thursday: 'Was GM really going to be able to match Tesla? Apple can.' This latest speculation follows sightings of mysterious camera-mounted cars registered to Apple in the US last week. At least two videos - one recorded in California, another filmed in Florida - suggest the top-secret project is more widespread than first thought. And rumours range from a Street View-style mapping service to an electric car that will rival Tesla or a self-driving van to rival Google. The Californian footage was sent to MacRumors and shows a silver people-carrier driving down a street in Palo Alto. The Florida recording was filmed on a highway in Coral Springs and uploaded by Apple Insider. This footage shows a white Dodge Caravan fitted with cameras on the roof. As the filmmaker pulls alongside the van, they wave at the two men inside. The passenger is seen concealing an iPad from view, while the driver points to the camera and drives off. The Florida recording (pictured) was filmed in Coral Springs. This footage shows a white Dodge Caravan fitted with cameras on the roof. As the filmmaker pulls alongside the van, they wave at the two men inside and the passenger is seen concealing an iPad from view . Other reports have spotted the vans in Hawaii and Wisconsin. The latest vans haven't officially been confirmed as belonging to Apple, but the similarities with previous confirmed sightings suggests they are. The far-reaching nature of the project lends more weight to the claims Apple is developing a mapping service. With 12 cameras on top of the car, however, some have said that is too many for it to be a mapping car like Google's Street View. Plus, reports recently claimed Apple has several hundred employees developing an electric car at a secret lab. This project has been dubbed 'Titan'. This Apple research lab was reportedly set up late last year - meaning any car could still be years away -  and is being overseen by Apple designer Sir Jonathan Ive. Apple could, of course, be using the vans for both projects. The Wall Street Journal added that hundreds of employees are working on the Titan project and boss Tim Cook approved the project close to a year ago. The Californian footage (pictured) was sent to MacRumors and shows a silver people-carrier driving down a street in Palo Alto . These reports followed rumours that Apple was developing a vehicle as part of a project that 'will change the landscape and give Tesla a run for its money.' The claims were made in an email from an unnamed Apple employee. In an interview last year, Apple board member Mickey Drexler said that before his death in 2011, Steve Jobs had considered building a car. An unnamed Apple employee recently hinted that the tech giant is developing a vehicle as part of a project that 'will change the landscape and give Tesla a run for its money.'  It followed sightings of an Apple-owned car fitted with cameras (pictured) in California . In particular, Apple may be working on an electric car to rival Tesla's range (the Tesla P85D is pictured) or the email could be referring to an advanced iPhone in-car control system that would rival Tesla's software . The head of self-driving cars for Google expects real people to be using them on public roads in two to five years. Chris Urmson said the cars would still be test vehicles, and Google would collect data on how they interact with other vehicles and pedestrians. But Mr Urmson wouldn't give a date for putting driverless cars on roads en masse, saying that the system has to be safe enough to work properly. He told reporters last month at the Automotive News World Congress in Detroit that he wants to reach the point where his test team no longer has to pilot the cars. He told Paul Goldberger: 'Steve Jobs was gonna design an iCar. I think cars have an extraordinary opportunity for cool design.' Alternatively, the Apple employee's email could be referring to an advanced iPhone in-car control system that would rival Tesla's software. The original Dodge van with the equipment on the top was spotted by the blog Claycord in San Francisco. The blog owners apparently asked the driver what he was doing, but he refused to give an answer. The California Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) confirmed the vehicle was leased to Apple. Last year, footage emerged of a self-driving Dodge Caravan that looked like the current Apple minivans. When contacted by MailOnline, Apple declined to comment on the car in question or what its purpose was. With 12 cameras on top of the mysterious Apple car, some have said that is too many for it to be a mapping car like Google's Street View (pictured left). Google launched its Street View technology in 2007, and has refined the technology ever since (Street View screenshot near Trafalgar Square in London pictured right) Alternatively, the vehicles spotted in California and Florida could be self-driving cars. The cameras on the mysterious vans could be used to scan the road and help engineers develop autonomous software, for example.

"Earlier this month the tracksuit tycoon Mike Ashley agreed to buy a plot of land in Chelsea from the retailer John Lewis for somewhere in the region of £200million. The Clearings has been primed for redevelopment, with planning permission for 62 luxury flats, seven townhouses and an agreement to relocate Marlborough Primary School as part of the project. In five years, when the operation to build the properties is concluded and they have been sold to high-end buyers, Ashley will add something in the region of another £1bn to his net worth. There have been empty seats at St James' Park recently as fans let their feelings about Mike Ashley be known . The weekend defeat by Swansea was a seventh straight Premier League loss for the Magpies . Toon keeper Tim Krul had to pick the ball out of his net three times against Swansea . Ashley looks after the money, obsessing over the finances at his business empire, which includes SportsDirect, Tesco and his football club in the north east. Last year his group made more than £500m. In return, he expects his employees, across the board, to deliver. The biggest motivation in Ashley’s life is to make money, something reflected in Newcastle United’s latest accounts, which are showing another decent profit and £34m in the bank. The money men at Newcastle are already aware that the team could play in an empty stadium when the new television deals crystallise at the start of the 2016-17 season and still turn a profit based on current income and expenditure. It feels like it could come to that as Newcastle’s disaffected supporters wonder where to take their grievances to next. Ashley, the club’s owner, does not appear to be listening. He is not a football man, certainly not in the same way as the increasing number of disillusioned supporters at St James’ Park. After seven straight defeats in the Barclays Premier League under their interim coach John Carver, they have every right to fear for the future. All is not well. It does not help that Ashley has taken a neanderthal approach to negative criticism, frequently banning journalists from St James’ because they have gone into bat on behalf of the team’s disaffected supporters. For such a successful businessman, Ashley’s sensitivity to criticism is undoubtedly one of his biggest weaknesses. Ashley (right) has never been Mr Popular at St James' Park but the protests have been ramped up recently . A fan appeared to have a go at interim manager John Carver during the latest loss at St James' Park . The view from the bench hasn't been pretty for Carver and the Newcastle staff during the last few weeks . He should address it because his ability to make money should be one of his most powerful weapons at Newcastle. In January, after a deal had been concluded to take Alan Pardew to Crystal Palace, the former Newcastle manager gave a momentary insight into the financial strategy at St James’ Park. ‘Newcastle is a big club, it’s difficult because it is run on an tight financial margin,’ admitted Pardew. ‘We had to work hard on transfers, the funds for a club that size makes it difficult to understand that we had to build slowly.’ So what is so wrong with that, especially when the owner of the club still has an interest-free loan of £129m marked in the latest Newcastle accounts? It is the job of Newcastle’s chief scout Graham Carr, along with his staff, to identify and recruit the players who can improve this team. Talent identification is not Ashley’s area of expertise and he has always made it clear that it is the responsibility of his scouting department to improve the squad. The natural conclusion when clubs sell their best players, as Newcastle did when Yohan Cabaye moved to Paris Saint-Germain in January 2014 and Mathieu Debuchy left for Arsenal last summer, is to lose momentum. It always feels like a lack of ambition. Then there are teams such as Southampton, who sold four of their best players last summer - Dejan Lovren, Adam Lallana, Calum Chambers and Luke Shaw - for £88m after finishing eighth in the Premier League. Newcastle fans held a protest urging fellow supporters to 'show Ashley the red card' They responded by recruiting Dusan Tadic, Graziano Pelle, Fraser Forster, Florin Gardos, Shane Long and Sadio Mane for an outlay of around £56m. Under Ronald Koeman, who replaced Mauricio Pochettino last summer after he moved to Tottenham, Southampton could still qualify for the Europa League. They are a fine example to the teams outside the top four because Southampton (with an annual income of £90m), Swansea (£84m) and Newcastle (£110m) cannot compete on the same financial terms. Swansea, who beat Newcastle 3-2  last Saturday, have also had a recent change in management after promoting Garry Monk. He has had an outstanding year in charge. Toon fans held up the cards during the latest protest against owner Ashley . Even with the loss of Wilfried Bony, sold to Manchester City for £28m in January, they are on course for a top-eight finish because of their own financial prudence and some smart recruitment. Like Southampton, they are not living above their means, but their transfer policy is first class. They are being rewarded for that. Newcastle are currently 19th in the annual Deloitte report into football’s rich list, but they do not have the same financial muscle as Manchester United (£371m), Manchester City (£277m), Chelsea (£277m), Arsenal (£219m), Liverpool (£208m) and Tottenham (£153m). This summer Ashley will make some new signings, something they desperately need after a depressing end to the season at St James’ Park. Without them, the balance sheet will be the only winner.",Newcastle United have lost seven Premier League games in a row . Fans protested against Mike Ashley during the latest loss against Swansea .

He was taken to Aberdeen Royal Infirmary on Easter Monday and spent a night in hospital being treated for his injuries before being discharged today. Scroll down for video . The Duke of Kent, 79, was spotted leaving Aberdeen Royal Infirmary with a walking stick today (above). The Queen's cousin was admitted to the hospital yesterday after suffering a dislocated hip at the Balmoral estate . His Royal Highness Prince Edward walked to his daughter Lady Helen Taylor's car with a walking stick before being driven away. Buckingham Palace said today that he had been 'successfully' treated for a dislocated hip . Buckingham Palace confirmed His Royal Highness Prince Edward's injury and said: 'The Duke of Kent was admitted on Monday to Aberdeen Royal Infirmary, where he was successfully treated for a dislocated hip. 'The Duke is expected to leave hospital later today.' The dislocation comes just two years after the Duke suffered a 'mild' stroke. In March 2013, he was taken to University College Hospital in London after suffering a the stroke, also known as a transient ischaemic attack. Despite his age, the Duke still undertakes a large number of royal engagements. He became the Duke of Kent at just six when his father died in a wartime flying accident in 1942. The Duke is the son of Prince George, the younger brother of King George VI and King Edward VIII. He enjoyed a lengthy military career and was a respected Army officer who also acted as Britain's international trade ambassador for 25 years. Nurses could be seen outside Aberdeen Royal Infirmary with the Duke and his daughter Lady Helen Taylor today. The Queen's cousin was driven away by his daughter after being discharged by doctors this afternoon . The Duke appeared downcast as he was driven away from the hospital by his daughter Lady Helen Taylor . He has since spent many years performing royal duties on behalf of the Queen and is perhaps now best known for being President of the All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club and presenting the Wimbledon trophies each summer. The royal is also the country's top Freemason - the secret society's Grand Master of the United Grand Lodge of England. His wife the Duchess of Kent has withdrawn from public life, dropping her HRH title. She now works as a music teacher, preferring to be known as 'Katharine Kent'. The couple have three children George, the Earl of St Andrews, Lady Helen Taylor, and Lord Nicholas Windsor.

"Under pressure Bayern Munich manager Pep Guardiola has revealed that 'only the treble is enough' for his team as they attempt to overturn their 3-1 deficit against Porto in the Champions League. Bayern host the Portuguese side on Tuesday and Guardiola is confident the Bundesliga leaders will emerge victorious. 'I am completely convinced that my players will take their chances,' Guardiola said. 'I know which club I am at and know that (league) champions and cup winners is not enough. Only the treble is enough.' Pep Guardiola is targeting winning  three trophies with Bayern Munich this season .

Philipp Lahm will look to lead his team into the semi-final of the Champions League on Tuesday . Bayern remain on course for three trophies, leading the Bundesliga by 12 points and will meet Borussia Dortmund in the German Cup semi-final. The Bavarians won the treble under then coach Jupp Heynckes in 2013, just before Guardiola took over. The current Bayern boss also won the treble with Barcelona in 2009, when they became the first Spanish club to win the domestic league and cup as well as the Champions League in the same season. Ahead of the visit of Porto, Guardiola said on Monday that France winger Franck Ribery is highly unlikely to recover from an ankle injury in time to feature for Bayern. Ribery has been out for more than a month and Guardiola said it was more likely the player would miss the second leg of the quarter-final in Munich as the Germans look to recover from a stunning 3-1 defeat in Portugal last week. 'I do not think that Franck can play,' Guardiola told reporters. 'I will speak with the our doctor but my feeling is that he can't make it.' Guardiola's hopes of turning the tie around have been hampered by a string of injury absences, including to key players Arjen Robben, David Alaba, Javi Martinez and Medhi Benatia. Bastian Schweinsteiger is also fighting to get fit in time for the game and Guardiola said the Germany captain would train with the team late on Monday for the first time.

The Spaniard, who wore a T-shirt made by the family of an Argentine journalist killed in a car crash at last year's World Cup, said his team would try everything to overturn the first leg deficit despite the injury problems.

"It has been a sci-fi dream for decades - a car that can simply take to the air to avoid traffic. However, a Slovakian firm has said it has finally cracked the problem - and it will sell in it just two years. The AeroMobil can fly 430 miles on a tank of petrol - and when its wings fold down, it'll fit into a normal parking space. Scroll down for video . Aeromobil is a 'flying car' that can fit in a standard parking space, and could both take off and land at any airport in the world. When in flight mode, it can go 430 miles, reaching 124mph - but can fold up its wings to travel on the road and fit in a single parking space. Aeromobil is a 'flying car' that perfectly makes use of existing infrastructure created for automobiles and planes, and opens doors to real door-to-door travel,' the firm says. When in its car configuration, it can fit into a standard parking space, and it also takes normal fuel pumped at every service station. The latest version is the third generation of the craft. 'It is now finalised and has been in regular flight-testing program in real flight conditions since October 2014,' the firm said. At South By Southwest, Juraj Vaculik, co-founder and CEO of AeroMobil, spoke at a panel about the future of flying cars, predicting a world ahead in which these vehicles easily merge with existing transportation. He says it will be on sale in 2017, and that the firm was also developing a self driving (and flying) version. Tatiana Veber, an AeroMobil spokesman said: 'We have been developing the concept of a flying car since 1990. 'Our first model looked quite bizarre and it would have problems in the regular use. 'That was a signal to improve the concept of the flying car in a way to become an integral part of the regular road traffic. The winds fold behind the driver of the car when it is on the road . The car seats two, although the pilot will need a licence to fly it. 'We got a positive feedback from several experts in avionics, which appreciated design and the technical solution of the process of transformation. 'The car is constructed to be fuelled at regular gas stations using the fuel for Rotax 912 ULS engine.' AeroMobil says its third prototype is ready to be shown to the world this October 29th at the Pioneers Festival in Austria. When in plane mode, the craft is powered by a propeller . The firm has even completed the interior of the craft, and says it is undergoing advanced flight tests in Slovakia. However, design is still not perfect- the wings fold into the back seat behind the driver when in car mode. The firm has also released a video of it in action, driving through city streets then taking to the air. 'Aeromobil 3 is stylish, comfortable for both the driver and passenger, and exceptionally combines the performance of a sports car with qualities of an 'ultralight',' it says. The vehicle can reach 200km/h when in the air, and 160km/h on the roads.","AeroMobil can fly 430 miles on a tank of petrol . When its wings fold down, it can fit into a normal parking space .

"What happens now? Australian officials have said they don't think missing Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 is in the patch of the southern Indian Ocean where underwater pings were picked up last month. Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott said in early April that authorities were ""very confident"" the signals were coming from the plane's flight recorders, raising hopes of closure among some of the families of the 239 people on board the passenger jet. But after spending weeks scouring the bottom of the ocean roughly 1,600 kilometers (1,000 miles) off Western Australia with a high-tech unmanned submarine, the searchers have drawn another blank, deepening the mystery surrounding the Boeing 777's fate. Officials say they are still trying to figure out the source of the signals that led the search for the past seven weeks. More than 11 weeks after Flight 370 dropped off radar screens over Southeast Asia on a scheduled flight to Beijing, officials in charge of the hunt are drawing a line through the ping-centered search and moving on to the next phase. Where does the search go next? The underwater search area guided by the pings covered more than 850 square kilometers (330 square miles). With that zone now ruled out, Australian authorities, who have been coordinating the search in the southern Indian Ocean, say attention will shift to a new area as large as 60,000 square kilometers. That's roughly the size of West Virginia. ""The search will be a major undertaking,"" the Australian Transport Safety Bureau (ATSB) said this week. ""The complexities and challenges involved are immense, but not impossible."" The underwater search will remain in the same overall region, as officials are basing their focus on an analysis of satellite, radar and other data that concludes the plane ended up somewhere along an arc stretching into the southern Indian Ocean. ""What has not changed at this stage is the belief that, after weeks of research and re-analysis, that the Inmarsat data is correct and that they are looking broadly in the right area,"" said Geoffrey Thomas, the editor in chief of Airlineratings.com, referring to the satellite data provided by the British company Inmarsat. ""Now clearly, we were hoping that the pings would narrow that broad area down to a narrow one, but that has not been the case, and now we have to unfortunately go the long road,"" Thomas told CNN. Will they start searching the new area immediately? No. In fact, it hasn't yet been fully mapped out. The ATSB said this week that it's reviewing existing information from experts in order to refine the new zone. Meanwhile, a specialized Chinese ship, the Zhu Kezhen, has begun mapping the ocean floor in some areas already picked out by the ATSB. A contracted commercial survey vessel will join those efforts next month. It's unclear how deep the water is in these areas because ""it's never been mapped,"" Australian Deputy Prime Minister Warren Truss said earlier this month. Officials say depths are likely to exceed 6,000 meters (20,000 feet). The survey will take about three months and ""give us crucial knowledge of the seafloor terrain needed to begin the underwater search,"" the ATSB said. Who will do the actual searching? That's still being figured out. The Bluefin-21, the robotic submersible supplied by the U.S. Navy that has been searching the area where the pings were detected, has reached the end of its mission. Search officials are regrouping and preparing to identify and deploy other high-tech equipment. But that's going to take some time -- up to two months, if not longer, according to Australian authorities. Officials say they want the next phase of the underwater search, which could take up to a year, to be led by a single private contractor who will bring together and manage several underwater assets in the search zone. Search coordinators say they are looking for sonar equipment that can be towed by a ship, an autonomous underwater vehicle with a mounted sonar device and optical imaging equipment. Some towed sonar devices, such as the U.S. Navy's Orion, can transmit data to the surface in real-time. They also have the capability of scanning a larger area than the Bluefin, which was limited to about 40 square kilometers during each mission. Only a handful of companies have such devices. Australian authorities say they plan to post their request for tenders for the next phase of the search in the coming days. Who's going to pay for it? That's another issue that isn't clear yet. Australia has estimated the next phase of the search will cost $60 million, with the breakdown of exactly who's going to pay for what yet to be announced. While 26 countries have participated in the hunt for the missing plane, Malaysia, China and Australia have held high-level talks about the future of the search. Malaysia is where the plane is from, most of the people on the flight were Chinese, and Australia had six passengers on board and is closest to the remote part of the Indian Ocean where searchers have focused their hunt. The United States has contributed a range of assets to the search so far, including the Bluefin-21, which costs an estimated $40,000 a day to operate. Are the searchers still looking in the right place? Australian officials say they remain confident in the conclusion -- reached by a team of experts from Boeing and aviation authorities around the world, including the United States and Europe -- that Flight 370 ended its journey in the southern Indian Ocean. Despite questions from independent experts, Inmarsat says it stands by its analysis of a series of communications between the plane and the company's satellite system that provided a key part of the conclusion about the jetliner's path. Earlier this week, Malaysian authorities released the satellite data from Inmarsat, meeting a long-standing request of some passengers' families who were unsatisfied by authorities' explanation of the plane's fate. Independent experts are now studying the data to see whether they agree with the official view.",The new search area is roughly the size of West Virginia .

"A mother-of-four whose addiction to Red Bull saw her drinking 24 cans of a day claims she has been cured of her habit by hypnosis. Sarah Weatherill, 31, became so dependent on the energy drink she was told if she cut down too quickly she could suffer a seizure as her body was so used to the caffeine. The law student spent a staggering £5,460 every year on the popular energy drink  since she became hooked in 2009. Scroll down for video . Sarah Weatherill, 31, was so addicted to Red Bull she drank 24 cans a day leaving her lethargic, depressed, suffering heart palpitations and constantly anxious . Her habit was at its worst the following year when she was studying for a law degree and wanted to stay awake to revise for exams. She soon became dependent on the drink and couldn't get out of bed unless she knew she had some in the fridge. She also became lethargic, depressed, had heart palpitations and was constantly feeling anxious as her £105-a-week habit spiralled out of control. She finally decided to do something about the problem after she realised the constant need for the Red Bull was severely damaging her health. And after seeing hypnotherapist earlier this month, she claims she has been cured of her addiction thanks to just one 50-minute session. Her habit had been so dangerous she needed to cut down to eight cans a day in the run up to the hypnosis - as coming off so much caffeine abruptly could have caused a seizure. A 250ml can of Red Bull contains: . 80mg of caffeine - the same amount as in an espresso. 27.5g sucrose and glucose combined - the equivalent of almost seven teaspoons of sugar. 10g Taurine (an amino acid that is thought to boost athletic performance). B vitamins. Ms Weatherill's 24-a-day habit meant she was drinking 1.92g of caffeine every day. A 2005 study into caffeine-related deaths said a person would need to ingest 5g to overdose, suggesting she was taking nearly half the potentially lethal dose. Ms Weatherill, from Coventry, said: 'I was studying for a Higher National Certificate in law in 2005 and used to have the odd Red Bull for a pick me up. 'It is hard to say when it became every day but I remember that by 2009 I was definitely hooked. 'Whenever I felt tired having a Red Bull would be the first thing I would do. 'It was  worst in 2010 when I was doing law exams at university and my children were off school. 'Sometimes I would have exams day after day - and with the stress of revising I was having 24 cans a day. 'I was pulling all-nighters and using the drinks to stay awake. In the end, it got to the point where I just needed Red Bull to function. 'I used to get my shopping delivered and used to have four or five crates and that only lasted for a week - it got out of hand. 'There would be times when I would get palpitations and shakes but I think I just got used to the caffeine.' Red Bull - whose slogan says the drink 'gives you wings' - is made by an Austrian company and is the highest selling energy drink in the world. Miss Weatherill claims she was cured of her addiction in one 50 minutes hypnotherapy session with David Kilmurry (pictured right) This table shows a range of drinks in order of caffeine content and their relation to daily allowances. Ms Weatherill was drinking 1.92g of caffeine every day, way above the recommended limit of 400 mg . The drink has been branded safe by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) and more than five billion cans were sold in 2013. However, it has been criticised for its high caffeine levels with one 250ml can containing 80mg, similar to one cup of coffee. Ms Weatherill's 24-a-day habit meant she was drinking 1.92g of the drug every day. A 2005 study into caffeine-related deaths said a person would need to ingest 5g to overdose, suggesting she was taking nearly half of a lethal dose. But, incredibly, she claims she was completely cured of her addiction after a single session with cognitive behavioral hypnotherapist David Kilmurry on April 11. Ms Weatherill, who lives with boyfriend Phil Evans, 27, and four children aged between three and 14, added: 'I knew at the start of this year it was a dependency so thought I would give hypnotherapy a go. 'It was a weird process, I felt like I was in there for 15 minutes but it was 50 minutes. 'All I can remember is that it was like a kaleidoscope effect, I remember him saying I didn't need Red Bull.' 'I am convinced I won't have another can. I feel like a different person,' Ms Weatherill said after undergoing hypnotherapy to cure her of her energy drink habit . She added: 'It was like a paralysis because I had an itch, but couldn't move to scratch it. 'It gave me a lot of strength because in the past I have tried to give up but lasted a week and then gone back to the Red Bull. 'I am convinced I won't have another can. I feel like a different person.' Hypnotherapist Mr Kilmurry added: 'Sarah's addiction was very serious. 'Coming off that amount of caffeine and taurine  can lead to seizures, so she gradually reduced her intake before coming to me to make a safe escape. 'Energy drink addicts can also suffer insomnia, depression, anxiety and heart palpitations. 'Luckily Sarah soldiered through and has been amazed at the changes.'","Sarah Weatherill, 31, spent £5, 460 every year on the popular energy drink .

"Wisconsin Gov. and rising Republican star Scott Walker refused on Wednesday to say whether he believes in evolution during a Q and A at a London think tank. After declining to answer numerous questions related to foreign policy, out of respect for the sitting President of the United States, the likely presidential candidate evaded the event moderator's question about evolution, telling him, 'For me, I am going to punt on that one as well.' 'That's a question a politician shouldn't be involved in one way or the other,' he added. Scroll down for video . 'That's a question a politician shouldn't be involved in one way or the other,' Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker said of evolution on Wednesday during an appearance at London-based think tank Chatham House . Even after his interviewer, Justin Webb of BBC Radio 4, asserted that 'any British politician right or left wing would laugh and say, ""yes of course evolution's true,"" ' Walked stood his ground. 'I'm here to talk about trade, not to pontificate on other issues,' he said, heartily adding, to laughter, 'I love the issue of trade in Wisconsin.' Recently elected to his second term as governor in The Badger State after surviving a recall challenge in his first term, Walker is now on the path to the GOP nomination for president. He has been making the rounds in early presidential states such as Iowa, where he reportedly leased office space this week, and is currently on a trip to the U.K. After fellow presumed Republican presidential contender Chris Christie's disastrous trip to England last week that involved the cancellation of several press conferences after the New Jersey politician came under attack in the U.S. for his lavish spending and his position on mandatory vaccinations, Walker's team said the Wisconsin governor would take no questions from reporters while abroad. The only exception was to be today's speech at Chatham House, an international affairs institute, followed by a sit down interview with Webb. But even then, Walker was not inclined to give direct answers to many of the questions put before him, according to reporters present. The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel said Walker excused himself from commenting on world affairs because he holds the 'old-fashioned' view that it's not appropriate  to 'talk about foreign policy while you're on foreign soil.' 'I don't think it's wise to undermine your own president' on trips such as these, he later said. Officially in Britain as part of a taxpayer-funded trade mission, the UK visit is widely seen as an opportunity for Walker to bulk up his foreign policy credentials before he formally announces a presidential bid. On Tuesday the Republican governor met with British Prime Minister David Cameron. Today he paid a visit to the speaker of the House of Commons, John Bercow. During the trip he also visited a Harley-Davidson dealership - the company was founded in Wisconsin, and stopped by the grave of British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, a conservative icon, to pay his respects. Walker is pictured leaving 10 Downing street after a private meeting with British Prime Minister David Cameron in London on Tuesday. Walker is leading a coalition of Wisconsin government and business officials on a trade mission that runs until Friday. The trip gives him a chance to bolster his overseas and foreign policy credentials as he considers running for president in 2016 . Walker is not alone among the probable GOP presidential candidates in his hesitancy to take a stance on evolution. Former governors Rick Perry of Texas and Bobby Jindal of Louisiana have both waffled when asked about the scientific origins of creation. Christie has also been won't to discuss the subject or anything related to foreign policy. Still, the Democratic National Committee took a shot at Walker on Wednesday afternoon over the ducking and dodging. 'For someone who went to London to build his street cred as a serious leader all Walker showed today was the same ducking and dodging Wisconsinites know all too well and that we’ve come to expect from the 2016 GOP field, whose policy positions are just too divisive to share,' the DNC's National Press Secretary, Holly Shulman, said in an email to reporters. 'Would’ve been a lot simpler to just stay home,' she added. In a separate email later in the day, DNC Communications Director Mo Elleithee trolled the Republican field and asked, 'Do any other GOP presidential candidates want to go to London? 'If so, let us know. The DNC is more than happy to pick up your travel costs,' Elleithee said.","'That's a question a politician shouldn't be involved in one way or the other,' Walker said during an appearance at Chatham House .

"(CNN)The sun cuts across Lake Nicaragua, casting shadows across lush flora and brightly colored boats. Rowing in unison, two girls paddle a canoe to school. Life on Lake Nicaragua is peaceful, rustic and isolated, but this could change with the pending completion of a canal that builders are likening to Panama's famed waterway. Headed by Hong Kong-based consortium HK Nicaragua Canal Development Investment Company (HKND), the $50 billion Nicaragua Canal (also called the Nicaragua Grand Canal and Interoceanic Canal) would create a gargantuan new shipping route through Nicaragua by connecting the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. HKND was granted a 50-year concession by the Nicaraguan government in 2013 to build and operate the 278-kilometer (172 miles) canal, reportedly with the option for an extension. Construction will run from the Rio Punta Gorda on the Caribbean Coast to Brito on the Pacific. At up to 1,700 feet wide and 90 feet deep, the canal, if completed, will be deeper and wider than the Panama Canal. HKND announced the start of construction of the canal with a ceremony on December 22, 2014. The canal will run through Lake Nicaragua (among other areas), Central America's largest lake and freshwater reservoir, which not only preserves an integral part of Nicaragua's ecosystem, but directly supports numerous communities. By some estimates, 30,000 people will have to be relocated to carve a path for the canal. The prospect is nothing short of alarming for those living in the area, and those who cherish its untouched splendor. With the pending completion of the canal in 2019, Lake Nicaragua may be impacted in ways only time will reveal. Environmental experts worry that the shallow waters of the lake won't be able to withstand the dredging that will come with construction. Additionally, communities will likely be displaced and wetlands may become more vulnerable to destruction. ""In terms of the canal impact on Lake Nicaragua, one big concern is the damage to the quality of the water; the ship traffic will pollute the water with toxic sediments and industrial chemicals and introduce destructive invasive species, plants and animals,"" Dr. Jorge A. Huete-Perez, vice president of the Nicaraguan Academy of Sciences and director of the Molecular Biology Center at the University of Central America told CNN. ""Dredging of the lake for the construction of the canal will render the lake a 'dead zone' because of hypoxia, eutrophication and turbidity."" In January, London-based scidev.net reported that an independent commission of experts -- including scientists from the InterAmerican Network of Academies of Science, Nicaraguan Academy of Sciences and International Council for Science -- had reached similar conclusions, warning of ""unintended adverse consequences that could do economic, environmental and social harm."" Like other critics of the canal construction, Huete-Perez wants greater transparency from HKND and the Nicaraguan government. ""This whole thing has been fast-tracked without public consultations or the opportunity for an informed, documented debate,"" said Huete-Perez. On January 9, 2015, HKND responded to concerns about the lake's impact on communities in a statement on its website. ""From July 21 to July 30, 2014, we and our environmental and social impact advisor, Environmental Resources Management (ERM), held scoping meetings across Nicaragua.  Approximately 5,000 people participated in the scoping meetings, including housewives, students, professionals, agricultural producers, fishermen, artisans, businessmen and scholars,"" reads the company's statement, in part. The company says it held a press conference broadcast in real time to the public to announce the route of the canal and comment on the technical, geological, cultural and environmental impact of the project. Some skeptics doubt the hyper-ambitious canal is realistic. Pedro Alvarez, chairman of civil engineering at Rice University, has expressed doubts that it will ever be completed. He worries that it will be abandoned. His greatest concern is severe damage to Lake Nicaragua. Despite the concerns of environmental experts, the project is underway, making a visit to this beautiful area more compelling than ever. Largely unmarred by development, Lake Nicaragua is a sight to behold. During my recent guided visit with Nicaragua Vacations, I took a boat tour through the Islets of Granada, home to 365 scattered islands with majestic views of Mombacho volcano. At times, there was no other boat in sight -- only the rustle of a hidden howler monkey in the bushes and the volcano, ensconced in clouds and morning fog. The feeling of being everywhere and nowhere at once is part of Lake Nicaragua's charm. Another part of its charm is the people who live on it. At Padre Nello School on Lake Nicaragua, about 90 children canoe to school each day. Jicaro Island EcoLodge works with Padre Nello to bring clean water to the children and educational projects that encourage sustainability on the lake. Guests of the lodge can arrange visits. The islets are just southeast of the city of Granada (population approximately 120,000), where colonial buildings defy time, narrow alleyways lead to garden courtyards, charming boutiques are full of local art and street carts overflow with everything from iguanas to cashews. While Granada pulses with Old World charm, Lake Nicaragua stands still with nature as its compass, mostly untouched by modernity. For now. Nicaragua Vacations; +1 866 347 4012 .

"The heartbroken parents of a beautiful four-week-old baby boy who died due to complications arising from whooping cough have been forced to defend themselves from online trolls. After urging other parents to get themselves and their children immunised against the deadly disease, Greg and Catherine Hughes have been inundated by messages from strangers - but not all of them have been kind. ‘To all the strangers sending me Facebook messages and asking why my son wasn't vaccinated. He was 4 weeks old!!! Too young to be vaccinated!,’ mother Catherine wrote on Facebook. ‘Go learn something about immunisation and stop bothering me. Our whole family was vaccinated but we live in the state with the worst vaccine rates and sometimes family vaccination just isn't enough to protect our babies,’ she added. Riley Hughes died at just 32 days old after suffering complications arising from whooping cough . Riley's parents Greg and Catherine Hughes have been inundated by messages from strangers . In the comments section of a Daily Telegraph article online a man named Rich also asked ‘if the mother of baby Riley was immunised and breast feeding?' 'This is one of the simplest ways to protect a child too young to be vaccinated,' he said. ‘Thank you for questioning me. I was fortunate to breastfeed my daughter for two years and my son Riley for the four weeks of his little life until he had to use a feeding tube in hospital, where I then expressed milk,’ Catherine responded. ‘I was also vaccinated as a child and received the booster shot three years before his birth, and was told my medical professionals this was sufficient. - Riley’s Mum.’ The couple, from Perth, who set up a Facebook page to honour their son Riley Hughes after he ‘passed away peacefully in the arms of his mummy and daddy’ at 2pm on March 17, aged just 32 days, publicly spoke about their son’s death in the hope it would help prevent more children dying from the preventable disease. Riley’s father Greg posted a touching tribute on Facebook to his ‘darling little angel Riley’ Two days before Riley died his mother posted a photo of him wrapped in a blanket in hospital . ‘Our greatest desire out of our own personal tragedy is to stop parents from having to endure the heartache of preventable childhood deaths,’ Riley’s dad Greg wrote on the Facebook page Light for Riley. Catherine Hughes has stood up to people who questioned her online . The newborn, born on February 13, died in Perth's Princess Margaret Hospital as a result of pneumonia-based complications arising from whooping cough. The brave family have now raised an incredible $36,000 for the Princess Margaret Hospital Foundation after setting up a fundraising page in honour of baby Riley. Greg Hughes wrote: ‘It was with a mixture of tears and joy that I logged on early this morning to see that we'd surpassed our initial goal of $32,000! The last few days have been unbelievably difficult for my family, but this incredible show of humanity has kept us occupied and given us a drive to change the world.’ Updating the more than 50,000 who now follow the Light for Riley Facebook page, Greg said ‘We're hearing that across Australia many Medical Practitioners, Pharmacies and Suppliers are completely out of the vaccine. ‘We've seen change in WA and NSW with whispers that other states are hopefully set to follow suit. None of this could have been achieved without the phenomenal response from the people on this page. The support has been worldwide and humbling to say the least. ‘Thank you so much for your continued support, please continue driving the message and donating to this worthwhile cause. We're just getting started.’ Two days before his death, his mother Catherine posted a devastating photo of her son wrapped up in a blanket in his hospital bed urging people to get themselves and their children immunised against whooping cough. The heartbroken parents of baby Riley have been forced to defend themselves from online trolls . Riley's father Greg appeared on Sunrise on Monday morning to thank the community for their fundraising and support . ‘If you haven't been immunised against whooping cough (pertussis) please consider getting it done. Heartbreaking to watch 4 week old Riley struggle with it at PMH please keep him in your thoughts!,’ she wrote. 'If you're anti-immunisation/anti-logic/anti-duty of care to your society as a whole, then feel free to take a look at this picture of my son in hospital right now at 4 weeks old with whooping cough - and then come and tell me how you think immunisation is a bad thing,' Greg added. On March 17 Catherine then posted the tragic news that Riley had died. ‘We are devastated to let everyone know our gorgeous sweet month-old son Riley John Hughes lost his battle with whooping cough at Princess Margaret Hospital earlier today,’ she wrote. ‘He passed away peacefully in our arms after a tough fight. The staff at PMH were amazing and did everything they could to save his little life but the whooping cough was too severe. RIP Riley. Forever in our hearts.’ His mother Catherine Hughes posted a brave tribute to her baby boy and thanked Perth's Princess Margaret Hospital for doing 'everything they could to save his little life' 'Heartbreaking to watch 4 week old Riley struggle,' Catherine Hughes wrote as she urged people to get themselves immunised . Riley’s father Greg also posted a touching tribute on Facebook to his ‘darling little angel Riley’. Greg wrote that Riley was ‘cruelly cut down before his life had an opportunity to start’. ‘I'm an absolute shell of a man without my baby boy and I'm truly not sure how I'll cope,’ he said as he honoured ‘the short but enormous legacy this little man has left behind’. The Facebook page Greg and Catherine have set up already has over 25,000 likes. Greg wrote that the family’s long-term goal is to ‘be the drivers of change within this country surrounding the treatment, management and long term eradication of this horrific disease. We invite you to share this page with anyone and everyone.’ Catherine told Mamamia that her whole family is immunised and that they had also asked their friends and families to have boosters. The Department of Health says it does not know how the child contracted the respiratory disease, also known as pertussis. Whooping cough is part of the routine vaccination schedule for babies at two months, four months and six months of age. Booster doses are given at 4 years and 10-15 years. Infectious Diseases Expert at ANU Medical School Canberra, Sanjaya Senanayake, told Daily Mail Australia: 'From my point of view immunisation is wonderful particularly for whooping cough.' Whooping cough (also known as ‘pertussis’) is a highly contagious bacterial infection of the lungs and airways. The government health website says the disease is 'highly infectious and most serious in babies under the age of 12 months'. Babies are at greatest risk of infection until they can have at least two doses of the vaccine (minimum 4 months old) as the mother’s antibodies do not provide reliable protection. It’s very rare for children who have been immunised against whooping cough to get the disease – and if they do, it’s usually not as serious. Symptoms . The condition usually begins with a persistent dry and irritating cough that progresses to intense bouts of coughing. These are followed by a distinctive ‘whooping’ noise, which is how the condition gets its name. The early symptoms of whooping cough are often similar to those of a common cold and may include: . These early symptoms of whooping cough can last for one to two weeks, before becoming more severe. The second stage of whooping cough is often called the paroxysmal stage and is characterised by intense bouts of coughing. Each bout of coughing usually lasts between one and two minutes. Infants younger than six months may not make the ‘whoop’ sound after coughing, but they may start gagging or gasping, and may temporarily stop breathing. Information supplied by HealthDirect.gov.au . The devastated parents have set up a Facebook page that already has over 25,000 likes . He explained infants are 'at a high risk of dying if they get infected' and that the death rate from whooping cough in infants under 6 months of age is about 1 per cent. 'It's important to listen to the experts,' Mr Senanayake said. 'Whooping cough is lethal in babies and in adults people can be absent from work for the persistent cough, it's a nasty infection.' According to the department's notifiable disease report, there have been 244 cases of whooping cough in WA in the year to date, compared to 292 cases for the corresponding period last year and 232 cases in the first 10 weeks of 2013. Data recorded on immunisation rates across Australia on the Department of Health's website shows, in 2012, WA had the lowest vaccination rates for whooping cough and for immunisation overall. In WA 91 per cent of children were immunised against diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis by 12 months of age and 90.2 per cent were fully immunised. In 2013, the Department of Health report said that despite a long-standing immunisation program, 'pertussis remains highly prevalent in Australia and the least well controlled of all vaccine-preventable diseases'. 'Epidemics occur every 3 to 4 years. In unvaccinated populations, these outbreaks can be very large. In vaccinated populations, outbreaks are smaller, with greatly reduced mortality and morbidity, and may continue to occur every 3 to 4 years or be more widely spaced,' the report said.","Riley Hughes died in a Perth hospital at just 32 days old on March 17 .

"A 22-year-old college student whose disappearance had police scouring Southern California for weeks said she was overwhelmed with personal problems when she decided to walk away. Sahray Barber, whose March 9 disappearance triggered a huge land and air search across Southern California's Inland Empire, resurfaced on March 19. She had spent the ten days living in two Los Angeles-area hospitals under assumed names. Scroll down for video . Sahray Barber vanished on March 9 from her home in San Bernadino, California, and a search effort began . The 22-year-old college student reappeared on March 19 after spending about ten days in LA hospitals . After leaving the second hospital, she met a woman who treated her kindly and finally got her to open up and to reach out to her father, Barber said. Barber called her father from a shelter after seeing news reports about her case and asked to come home. While she was gone, a huge search involving aircraft, dogs and horseback riders was being carried out by police. Barber released a statement to the Riverside Press-Enterprise Enterprise on Thursday trying to explain what happened to her. She said she had lost her job, her car had been wrecked and computer problems were causing her to fall behind in her studies at the Art Institute of California-Inland Empire. She wrote: 'Things got so bad that I didn't know what to say or who to ask for help, . 'I had dug a hole so deep, that I felt entirely hopeless.' She called her father from a shelter after seeing news reports about her case and asked to come home . Barber indicated that she paid little attention to media reports of the search while she was in the hospital, but was stunned when she found out all it involved. The young woman called what she did 'incredibly dumb'. She wrote: 'I ask for everyone's forgiveness, most especially my wonderful family for all the worry and long nights I caused you, and all the amazing men, women, dogs and horses that searched for me.' On the day she vanished, Barber walked out of her apartment, threw her computer and a few other belongings over a wall and left with just a few dollars in her pocket. Her disappearance was even more concerning because two women had recently been assaulted on the campus of California State University, San Bernardino, near Barber's home. San Bernardino Police Chief Jarrod Burguan said the department will seek criminal charges against Barber's roommates. They gave statements to police that indicated Barber had been killed, according to Burguan.

"By . Darren Boyle . PUBLISHED: . 13:59 EST, 12 March 2014 . | . UPDATED: . 16:18 EST, 12 March 2014 . Robert Bastin, lighting a cigarette outside Exeter Magistrates' Court where he admitted stealing a retro penny farthing outside a house in Honiton . A 20-year-old man is facing jail after he stole a penny farthing bicycle so he could get back home - 14 miles away. Robert Bastin stole the bike outside a house in Honiton after Christmas drinks with his brother, a court heard. The jobless labourer rode the stolen bike 14 miles to his flat. The court heard that Bastin decided against returning the bike to Honiton following the theft and instead attempted to sell it on eBay. Defence lawyer Peter Woodley told a court today: 'He was trying to get home. He had had a Christmas Day drink with his brother and it looked like a good idea. 'But a penny farthing is not the easiest thing to return to its owner.' On his eBay listing, Bastin claimed: 'not really my thing prefer my unicycle'. He also maintained that he had only used it three times since new. Devon and Cornwall Police saw the listing on January 12 and placed a £75 bid on the bike. The court heard that Bastin accepted the bid, unaware that it was an undercover police officer. He insisted that the buyer paid cash and collected the bike from his home. Bastin was arrested and the penny farthing was returned to its owner. A penny farthing bicycle similar to the one stolen by Robert Bastin. The retro edition is built by Hawk Cycles in Derby . Robert Bastin stole the bike from Honiton and rode it to his flat in Exeter . Robert Bastin was ordered to return to Exeter Magistrates' Court next month where he will be sentenced . Bastin, of Honiton, Devon, admitted stealing the bike while on bail for other offences. He also admitted aggravated vehicle taking and not having any insurance or licence on December 6. Exeter magistrates court heard that Bastin was riding a motor bike at 5am on the A30 near Exeter airport at speed. The penny farthing was one of the first ever bikes manufactured when it was introduced in 1870. The bicycle received its name due to its distinctive wheels which resembled Victorian penny and farthing coins. It was invented by James Starley and was unusual because the pedals were fixed directly to the front wheel. The penny farthing had solid rubber wheels and a very high centre of gravity - making it very unstable and difficult to ride. It also did not have brakes or suspension. Production eventually ceased in 1878. A new version of the historic bicycle was developed by Hawks Cycles in 2004. It features steel caliper brakes and a modern steel alloy frame costing £150. Police said his riding was 'erratic and wobbly' and he was doing around 20mph over the speed limit before he rode through a red light and through a No Entry sign. Police did not pursue him because they felt it would be unsafe to do so. Later Bastin was arrested by police who discovered DNA evidence linked to the crime from a motorcycle helmet and his clothes. Mr Woodley said the joyriding offence happened at 5am when the main road was 'relatively clear but said it was not the 'worst case of excessive speed' or dangerous driving. He said the jobless labourer was not coping with life over Christmas after losing his job and splitting up from his partner and young child. 'He had no money and was not thinking straight,' said Mr Woodley who said the court had the power to imprison him for a maximum of 12 months. The magistrates ordered an all-options pre-sentencing report - including custody. Bastin was bailed to return to court next month for sentencing.",Robert Bastin claimed he was selling the penny farthing because he preferred his unicycle .

"An energetic and inquisitive seven-year-old girl whose mind is 'trapped in a body' that will not do what she wants has won £10.1 million damages. The award to Eva Totham, after a three-day hearing at London's High Court in December, is believed to be one of the highest ever made for a personal injuries claim following a contested trial.

"London (CNN) -- The parents of Pakistani teen activist Malala Yousafzai arrived Thursday in Britain to reunite with their daughter, who has become an international symbol of courage after being shot by the Taliban for demanding education for girls. The 15-year-old, who at times has been unconscious, is being treated in a Birmingham hospital for a gunshot wound to the head. Her father, Ziauddin Yousafzai, has been a central influence for Malala. He ran a school in Pakistan's conservative Swat Valley that kept its doors open to girls -- in defiance of the Taliban. Her parents' arrival on Thursday came 10 days after Malala was flown to Britain. Arrests made in shooting of Pakistani schoolgirl . Malala has been unable to speak because a tube has been inserted into her trachea to protect her airway, which was swollen after her injury. ""I am leaving this country with a heavy heart and in extraordinary circumstances because the whole country knows that it is essential that I be with my daughter during her recovery,"" her father told Pakistani network PTV before leaving Islamabad, in his first public remarks since the October 9 shooting. ""With the nation's prayers she survived the attack and she will surely recover and her health will progress. And, God willing, as soon as she is recovered, I will be back in Pakistan."" Khushal Khan, Malala's younger brother, called for the nation to rally behind his sister. ""I want to tell all my friends to pray for Malala,"" he said. Opinion: Why Malala should not be turned into modern Joan of Arc . Malala has been thinking about school even while she lies in her hospital bed, Interior Minister Rehman Malik told reporters after meeting with her family -- she asked her father to take her school books with him. ""The mission she has taken forward and the education awareness that has spread across Pakistan is all Malala's doing,"" he said, according to PTV. ""So I think that our entire nation should be proud of her love for the soil of her country."" After Malala recovers and returns to Pakistan, he said, ""we will provide her with complete security, despite anyone's refusal, to ensure that something like this never happens again. The attack on Malala was a mindset of people who don't want to see this country progress."" Pakistan President Asif Ali Zardari has spoken with the girl's father, asking him to stay in Britain as long as necessary while his daughter recovers, Rehman Malik said. Malala has been communicating with medical staff by writing notes, the hospital has said. What's your message for Malala? As of Thursday, Malala ""continued to respond well to treatment,"" the hospital's website said. She is expected to need ""a significant period of rest and recuperation"" before undergoing reconstructive surgery, Dr. Dave Rosser, medical director of University Hospitals Birmingham, said last week. That surgery could involve reinserting a piece of her own skull or fitting her with a titanium plate. Malala was fighting an infection, but was able to move her extremities and has stood with help from nurses, the hospital said. Although the bullet grazed her brain as it passed from above her eye into her shoulder, she understands where she is and seems to be functioning well intellectually, it added. Malala sent a message of thanks to the thousands of people in Pakistan and elsewhere who have attended rallies and vigils honoring her courage and praying for her recovery. The Taliban have claimed responsibility for the shooting, but don't appear to have anticipated the level of condemnation it would provoke. Malala initially gained international attention in 2009, as the Taliban gained a foothold in her home region of Swat, a Taliban redoubt in northwest Pakistan, near Afghanistan. Girl shot alongside Malala haunted by attack . On her blog, Malala wrote about her life in the region, a center of militant activity where girls schools were shuttered and strict Islamist rules imposed. In her writings, which earned her Pakistan's first National Peace Prize, she encouraged young people to oppose the Taliban. Pakistani police said Wednesday that six men have been arrested in Swat in connection with Malala's shooting, but the primary suspect remained at large. Police have identified Atta Ullah Khan, a 23-year-old man from the district where she was attacked, as the primary suspect. Police said they were searching for Khan, who was studying for a master's degree in chemistry. CNN's Jonathan Wald and Shaan Khan contributed to this report.","Plane carrying Malala's parents lands in Birmingham, England .

"London (CNN) -- Janet Jackson is opening up for the first time about a duet with her brother that she's reviving two years after his death. Jackson took to the stage in London on Thursday and performed their 1995 song Scream as video of Michael Jackson played and his voice filled Royal Albert Hall. The reworked duet follows in the footsteps of jazz pianist and singer Nat King Cole and his daughter, Natalie Cole. In 1991 she turned her father's famous 1961 recording ""Unforgettable"" into a father-daughter duet. Janet Jackson said she did the original duet at the request of her brother years ago. ""I was on the Rhythm Nation tour and Mike actually asked me to do a song with him and I told him no. I didn't want to do it. I felt I hadn't come into my own and I hadn't fully made a name for myself ... and I didn't want to ride anyone's coattails,"" she said. ""And I remember being in the Janet Tour a few good years later and he asked me again if I would do a song with him. And I felt, at that point, I'd carved my own little niche in this world of music and I felt okay, I can do this now and that's how it came about."" Jackson said that performing the song alongside her brother again isn't difficult. ""It feels great -- just listening to and hearing his voice,"" she said, adding that on stage she finds herself, ""remembering the experience of recording it."" Jackson declined to comment to the press on the two-year mark of her brother's death, instead taking to social media this week with a simple message on Twitter on the June 25 anniversary: ""I miss you, I love you."" Jackson wraps up the European leg of her tour this week then heads to North America, Australia and Africa.","Jackson performs virtual duet on stage in London .

"They say money can corrupt even the most honest of people. Now one social psychologist has revealed a series of experiments that shows this adage to be true. Instead of transforming people into a charitable benefactors, Professor Paul Piff believes money causes people to break the rules at the expense of others. Professor Paul Piff from the University of California, Berkeley, has revealed several experiments in which the rich struggled with empathy and generosity towards others, compared with their poorer companions . 'It makes you more attuned to your own interests, your own desires, your own welfare,' the University of California, Berkeley, researcher told Lucy Hooker at the BBC. 'It isolates you in certain ways from other people psychologically and materially. You prioritise your own needs and your own goals and become less attuned to those around you. In one experiment, Professor Piff spent an afternoon going back and forth over a pedestrian crossing in Los Angeles. He found that none of the least expensive cars broke the law, while almost 50 per cent of the most expensive car drivers sped across the pedestrian crossing. In another recent study, Professor Piff brought in more than 100 pairs of strangers into the lab, and flipped a coin to assigned one of the two to be a rich player in a rigged Monopoly game. The rich players collected twice the salary when they passed Go, and they were able to roll both dice instead of one, so they got to move around the board more. Money isolates people psychologically and materially, according to recent research. As a result they prioritise their own needs and goals and become less attuned to those around them . Hidden cameras revealed, over the course of 15 minutes, the rich player showing signs of dominance, smacking the board with their piece and talking loudly. The rich players also became ruder toward the other person, less sensitive to the plight of the poor players, and more demonstrative of their material success. The feeling of power has been found to have a similar effect on the brain to cocaine. It increases the levels of testosterone and its by-product 3-androstanediol in both men and women. This in turn leads to raised levels of dopamine, the brain's reward system called the nucleus accumbens, which can be very addictive. Like cocaine, scientists now believe power can lead to too much dopamine causing more negative effects such as arrogance and impatience. 'When the rich players talked about why they had inevitably won in this rigged game of Monopoly they talked about what they'd done to buy those different properties and earn their success in the game,' Professor Piff said in a recent Ted talk. 'They became far less attuned to all those different features of the situation, including that flip of a coin that had randomly gotten them into that privileged position in the first place. 'And that's a really, really incredible insight into how the mind makes sense of advantage.' Other scientists have conducted similar studies to back up the findings. Last year, after undergoing psychological testing to measure individual differences, including honesty, a group of volunteers in Switzerland played the 'dictator game'. In the game, they were given complete control over deciding pay outs to themselves and their followers. The leaders had the choice of making pro or anti-social decisions - the latter resulting in awarding less money to the group but more to the leader's own earnings. The findings showed those rated as less honest at first exhibited more corrupt behaviour. But, over time, even those who initially scored high on honesty scales were not shielded from the corruptive effects of power, according to the University of Lausanne in Switzerland. Professor Piff, however, says not all hope is lost for the wealthy. 'We've been finding in our own laboratory research that small psychological interventions, small changes to people's values, small nudges in certain directions, can restore levels of egalitarianism and empathy. 'For instance, reminding people of the benefits of cooperation, or the advantages of community, cause wealthier individuals to be just as egalitarian as poor people.' In one study, volunteers watched a brief video, 46 seconds long, about childhood poverty that served as a reminder of the needs of others in the world around them. 'After watching this video, an hour later, rich people became just as generous of their own time to help out this other person, a stranger, as someone who's poor,' said Professor Piff.","This is according to Paul Piff from University of California, Berkeley . His tests reveal money isolates people psychologically and materially . In a rigged game of monopoly, richer players were rude and dominant . Another study found people in better cars were more likely to break law .",207243f8179ed42de850bdfaa34034d6e200a786
"A deskbound worker has used a GoPro camera to capture a unique view of his boring office job, turning even the most mundane day-to-day tasks into a high octane activities. Daniel Williams, from Toronto, filmed himself doing everything from sealing envelopes and sending emails to making cups and coffee and going to the bathroom, before editing all of the clips together to offer an action-packed perspective of his regular daily life. The video, which is titled 'Boring Office Job GoPro Commercial', has clearly struck a chord with people working in similar jobs around the globe, with the video already attracting an impressive three million views since being uploaded to YouTube last week. Office space: Daniel Williams, an office worker from Toronto, captured his entire day with a GoPro camera . Bright idea: Mr Williams came up with the idea after seeing other breathtaking GoPro videos online . The 90-second video makes a change from the usual, dramatic content normally caught by such cameras which, thanks to their durability, are often used to film some of the most breathtaking moments in life from base jumps to shark encounters. This time, however, viewers are treated to Mr WIlliams removing staples, photocopying, stuffing envelopes, drinking coffee, and even going to the bathroom. All set to a techno beat, the pacey clip turns a regular 9-to-5 office job into something far more exhilarating.

The video has thus far earned a huge amount of praise from viewers on YouTube, many of whom have been quick to comment about how well Mr Williams has managed to capture the mundane repetition involved in a typical office job. 'So good. So accurate,' said YouTube user Ryan Bobbe.

"(CNN) -- Fashion lovers crowded into a limestone townhouse on the prestigious Upper East Side of New York City on Wednesday night for an exclusive designer showcase. The house didn't belong to posh members of the high fashion elite, but to the Consulate General of the Russian Federation. The Russian Fashion Industry Showcase and Reception is one of several nationally-driven shows at New York Fashion Week promoting textile and apparel production unique to the countries. Upcoming shows will highlight the best in material and design from Korea, Japan, France and Scandinavia, but Wednesday night was all about the Russians. The evening embodied the Imperial Russia zeitgeist; chandeliers dripped with crystal, women glided about draped in fur, well-tailored men straightened their pocket squares as they passed gilded mirrors. The crowd sipped vodka and ogled designs from a conglomerate of modern Russian designers, including Serguei Teplov, Dmitry Loginov, Tegin, Irina Shaposhnikova, Sergey Polyakov and Aleksandr Khrisanfov. American figure skater Johnny Weir, who has his eyes on a third Olympic Games, in the Russian city of Sochi, stopped in and posed for photos. Russia's storied history was on display: A model's hair was mussed into a babushka headpiece; another stood with the rigid posture of a ballerina in laser-cut leather; all of them wore black outfits reflective of the country's harsh climate and lack of sunshine. ""New York City itself and, by default, Fashion Week is an avowedly international forum where everyone is welcomed and, for the most part, accepted,"" said Stephan Rabimov, the founder and editor in chief of DEPESHA magazine, which co-sponsored the event. ""It's a new type of communication channel to promote national interests: fashion, culture, tourism."" Rabimov said the U.S. fashion consumer is the perfect client for any ambitious designer. High-style buyers are, on average, well-educated professionals with lots of disposable income. Not only is the U.S. consumer a draw to international outlets, but New York is a global fashion capital on par with Paris, Milan and London. ""The American market is, simply, among the biggest, and they're very creative. As much as we can celebrate the savoir-faire of the French, I think Americans are the most creative,"" said Elisabeth Leontieff-Hirshon, a senior manager of UBIFRANCE. The Academy of Art University in San Francisco is showing a collaborative collection sponsored by UBIFRANCE, the French Trade Commission, on Friday at Lincoln Center in an effort to boost the profile of French mills in the United States. The collaboration was launched after approximately 250 meters of fabric was donated by French mills to the university, according to Leontieff-Hirshon. Leontieff-Hirshon said the appeal of partnering French textiles with American students is that U.S. designers are typically more open to new fabrics and new ideas. ""The American market knows what's good and what's selling; they're visionaries,"" she said. An emerging market stepping onto the catwalk: Asia. Concept Korea is a collaborative show organized by the Ministry of Culture, among other state agencies. On display: true Gangnam style. During Concept Korea's show at Mercedes-Benz Fashion Week last September, Korean designer Kathleen Kye showcased for the first time. That appearance later helped launch her collection at Opening Ceremony, a boutique synonymous with fashion ambassadorship, featuring designs from a different country each year. ""It is a must that we create a presence in New York in order to step into global market,"" said Sang-Pyo Hong, chief director at Korea Creative Content Agency. Leather Japan is yet another Asia-driven show sponsored by the country's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry. Eight Japanese brands will showcase Japanese leather products, hoping to highlight the designers' craftsmanship, said Kaoru Imajo, a spokesman for the event. While the country's economy is flagging, new Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has recently advocated stimulating growth by increasing exports; a somewhat contentious strategy because it could correlate with a depreciation of Japan's currency. ""The Japanese yen is expensive now, so that is not good for exporting, but the brands are trying everything they can to make it better,"" said Imajo. Rounding out the globe, there's a Scandinavian showcase with designers SIPILÃ„, Viola Blu and Olav making their debut to the U.S. market. Also showing is EDUN, a label working to increase trade with Africa that was launched in 2005 by Ali Hewson and her husband, U2 frontman Bono. While it's common practice for government-run organizations to participate in international trade shows like COTERIE and PremiÃ¨re Vision, governments actively orchestrating Fashion Week events is a recent development. ""That's why everyone who actually wants to sell clothes flocks here vying for interest of the best buyers and best media,"" said Rabimov. ""It is a perfect mix to launch a new brand, revamp heavyweights or showcase any country's fashion industry potential.""

"(CNN) -- Texas Gov. Rick Perry's suggestion that the United States may send troops to fight Mexican drug cartels riled officials and spurred debate from analysts on both sides of the border Monday. Mexico's top representative in the United States rejected the idea, which the Republican presidential candidate mentioned at a New Hampshire campaign stop Saturday. Mexican Ambassador Arturo Sarukhan told reporters his country's longstanding opposition to the presence of American forces had not changed. ""The matter of the participation or presence of U.S. troops on Mexican soil is not on the table,"" Sarukhan said Monday. ""It is not a component that forms part of the innovative approaches that Mexico and the United States have been using to confront transnational organized crime."" Perry said Saturday that leaders from Mexico and the United States should meet after next year's elections to address the deadly drug trade. ""It may require our military in Mexico working in concert with them to kill these drug cartels and to keep them off of our border,"" he said. Analysts in the United States and Mexico said the controversial idea could have significant political consequences and security implications -- even as a political campaign proposal. ""It may be well-intentioned, but it has the potential of really undermining cooperation between the U.S. and Mexico,"" said Eric L. Olson, who studies security relationships between the neighboring countries at the Mexico Institute of the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars in Washington. The United States admits its drug market plays a role in fueling violence in Mexico, and has pledged $1.4 billion in assistance through the so-called Merida Initiative, which includes programs to help train Mexican military, police and justice officials. ""If there's a perception in Mexico that this is all designed somehow as a backdoor entry into Mexico by the U.S., if there's a perception that this is leading to the United States' direct intervention into Mexico, it puts at risk all those cooperative efforts,"" Olson said. George W. Grayson -- author of ""Mexico: Narco-Violence and a Failed State?"" -- described Perry's proposal as ""absolute, unadulterated nonsense."" ""The first thing you'd have to fight is the Mexican Army if you sent troops in there. It's ludicrous,"" he said. Even if they don't gain traction, Perry's comments will likely resonate in campaign rhetoric beyond the United States' borders, as presidential campaigns in Mexico are also kicking into high gear, Grayson said. ""Typically this is a time of nationalism and breast-beating by candidates. ... The politicians are the ones who are going to walk all over it. They're going to say, 'See, the gringos are coming after us,'"" he said. Several Mexican lawmakers -- who the country's constitution says would need to approve any presence of U.S. soldiers -- expressed concern about Perry's comments Monday. Institutional Revolutionary Party Sen. Maria de los Angeles Moreno said U.S. troops in Mexico would be a clear ""aggression."" ""We must make an effort to face our own challenge, the violence of the criminals and the organized crime groups, but with our own forces and always maintaining the control of our territory,"" said Sen. Carlos Navarrete of the left-wing Democratic Revolution Party. But security analyst Pablo Monzalvo said when it comes to U.S. involvement, some Mexican officials are prone to double speak -- allowing U.S.-led measures to occur even as they speak out against them. Earlier this year Mexico's foreign minister fielded questions from angry lawmakers who said U.S. surveillance of Mexican territory -- aimed at detecting criminal groups -- was illegal. ""There is interference...and this has been said publicly. But I ask myself what has been accomplished by ceding a certain amount of authority,"" Monzalvo said. Perry, who was first elected governor of Texas in 2002, has faced criticism from opponents who have attacked his conservative bona fides on illegal immigration at a series of debates this fall. ""He's trying to compensate and say, 'Yeah, I'm really tough on Mexico,' but I think he's overcompensated,"" said Grayson, who is also a professor of government at the College of William and Mary in Williamsburg, Virginia. This isn't the first time Perry has called for greater force fighting drug cartels. Last year he asked U.S. President Barack Obama to send 1,000 additional National Guard troops to the border. ""We must show the cartels that Washington will no longer tolerate their terrorizing and criminalizing the border region,"" he wrote in a letter to the president. Troops crossing the border, however, is a different matter, Olson said. ""No Mexican wants the U.S. to send its military troops. ... They welcome cooperation and they welcome the U.S. accepting responsibility for its role, but they don't welcome the notion of sending troops. That's crossing a line,"" he said. CNN's Isabel Morales and Rachel Streitfeld contributed to this report.","The Texas governor says fighting the drug trade ""may require our military in Mexico"" Mexico's ambassador says the presence of U.S. troops ""is not on the table"" The idea could have serious political and security consequences, analysts say .

"Ed Miliband, pictured here with his wife Justine, has been challenged by MPs to prove that he did not try to avoid tax in relation to his property dealings . Ed Miliband faced calls last night to publish full details of his tax affairs. The Labour leader’s family affairs have come under the spotlight after he spent much of last week condemning ‘tax dodgers’. The Daily Mail told yesterday how he and his family used a ‘deed of variation’ to divide ownership of their family home – which experts say is used almost exclusively to reduce death duty bills. It has now emerged that Mr Miliband and his partner Justine Thornton – his wife since 2011 – both sold separate flats they owned in upmarket North London in 2008 and 2009 without paying capital gains tax. Mr Miliband sold his £740,000 apartment five months after the purchase of their family home for £1.6million and six months after the couple had their first son. But he claimed that the flat was his ‘primary residence’. Saying the flats were their primary homes enabled them both to save tens of thousands of pounds in capital gains tax. Labour yesterday insisted any suggestion of tax avoidance is a ‘straightforward lie’. And today Mr Miliband is expected to say he is ‘not backing down’ in his campaign against tax avoidance, despite the controversy about his own affairs. In a speech to the Welsh Labour conference he will accuse ministers of ‘turning a blind eye’ to tax avoidance. But the Conservatives last night stepped up pressure on him to publish the details of his tax affairs. Mr Miliband managed to avoid paying capital gains tax on the sale of the flat he owned before moving into the townhouse where his family now live. Mr Miliband met Miss Thornton in 2002. In the following years, they owned separate flats. He originally had an apartment on Chalcot Square but sold this for £342,000 in 2005, before buying a flat on nearby Chalcot Road about a year later for £648,500. It is not known where Mr Miliband, then 36, lived in the intervening months. But Miss Thornton owned a flat in Maida Vale. This was sold for £680,000 in March 2008, with Miss Thornton paying no capital gains tax. A Labour spokesman has said this is because it was her primary residence. Yet when Mr Miliband sold his flat on Chalcot Road for £740,000 in December 2009, he did not pay capital gains tax either, as he claimed this was his primary residence. This is despite the fact that five months earlier Miss Thornton – an environmental law expert on around £200,000 a year – had bought for £1.6 million the family home near Hampstead Heath where they now live. She had also given birth to their first son Daniel earlier that year, in June 2009. They were able to avoid the tax in part because they were unmarried. Mr Miliband and Miss Thornton became engaged in 2010 and married a year later. Miss Thornton, however, is still registered as the sole owner of their four-bedroom Victorian property for reasons that are unclear. Tory MP Andrew Bridgen said Mr Miliband’s family’s deed of variation was clearly designed to cut inheritance tax and condemned the Labour leader’s denial of this. He added: ‘Ed Miliband should now publish this deed of variation that he is currently hiding away and be as open about his own tax affairs as he demands others to be. The public can then judge for themselves.’ The former Director of Public Prosecutions Sir Keir Starmer, now a Labour parliamentary candidate, added: ‘People will take different views on deeds of variation and all forms of tax relief is, in one sense, intended to reduce tax. People have a strong feeling that sophisticated tax avoidance is morally wrong.’ MPs want to know if Mr Miliband and his family used tax avoidance strategies when trading houses . Mr Miliband has spent the week lambasting tax dodgers in the wake of allegations that HSBC’s Swiss private bank helped clients evade tax. He had gone on the attack over allegations of tax avoidance activities linked to some wealthy supporters of the Conservative Party, telling the House of Commons that David Cameron was ‘a dodgy Prime Minister surrounded by dodgy donors’. Mr Miliband was subsequently forced to defend his own tax affairs. Asked by BBC political editor Nick Robinson if he thought it was ‘dodgy’ to use a deed of variation and leave your house to your children to avoid tax, the Labour leader said: ‘The deed of variation... is something my mother did 20 years ago. I paid tax as a result of that transaction, I’ve avoided no tax in that.’ Mr Miliband’s father’s will was changed by deed of variation after his death in 1994 so Ed, David and their mother Marion all became part-owners of their £2.4million family home. This meant that if she then died, the sons would already own part of the property so inheritance tax would be applicable to less of the home than were she to have owned it outright. Mr Miliband has, however, since sold his share to his brother, who bought the remainder from his mother, who is still alive. He also claims to have paid capital gains tax at 40 per cent on the sale and denied he used the arrangement to avoid tax. A spokesman said: ‘It can’t be tax avoidance if no tax was avoided.’ Last night a spokesman for Mr Miliband insisted the couple only moved in together in 2008 – six years into their relationship and when Mr Miliband was 38 and Miss Thornton 37. ‘As HMRC guidance makes clear, primary residence relief continues for three years after you leave your home. The final 36 months of ownership always qualify for relief as long as the dwelling house has been your only or main residence at some point.’ BY JAMES CONEY, MONEY MAIL EDITOR . Why did the family change Ralph Miliband’s will? Changing someone’s will using a deed of variation is a relatively rare event and requires the agreement of all the beneficiaries – so why did the Miliband family do it? Was it because their father had forgotten something, or was it simply for tax planning reasons? If Mrs Miliband wanted to give some of the house to her sons she could have done that without changing her husband’s will – but this would have given her a tax liability when she continued living in the property. By altering the will and essentially making Ralph Miliband give a share of the house to his sons as a gift, Mrs Miliband was allowed to remain living there tax free. It also meant that when Ed and David came to inherit the house their tax liabilities would have been reduced. Figures produced for the Mail suggest this could have saved them £160,000 if they had inherited in 2004. George Bull, senior tax partner at accountancy firm Baker Tilly said: ‘A deed of variation is an established part of tax planning but it is not that common. Generally in the event of someone’s death the beneficiaries of the estate usually accept what is written in the will and shrug their shoulders and say that is that.’ What did Ed Miliband class as his main home from 1995 until 2004? In 1995 Ed Miliband owned 20 per cent of the family home in Edis Street, but also bought a second-floor flat in nearby Chalcot Square for around £100,000. Then in 2004 David bought the Edis Street property outright from Ed and their mother. You do not pay capital gains tax when you sell your main home, but you do have to pay tax on any gains you make above a certain level on a second home. In 2004, this was charged at a person’s highest income tax rate on gains of more than £8,200. Ed says he paid tax of 40 per cent on the sale of his stake of Edis Street to David. But exactly how much was the bill? Second-home owners have to notify HM Revenue & Customs which property is their main home. But they can switch this at any time. Every time they do this, the previous three years of house price gains are discounted (as the rules stand today, it is only 18 months). This allows second-home owners to reduce their tax liability when prices are rising fast. If Edis Street was not classed as his main home, it is estimated Ed’s captial gains tax bill could have been up to £56,000, depending on other gains he cashed in at that time. So which property was Ed living in from 1995, and which did he tell HMRC was his main home? Was it ever switched? Where did Ed and Justine live ? Ed Miliband first met Justine Thornton in 2002 and they married in 2011. For most of this time up until 2009 they each owned their own property. Last night a Labour Party spokesman insisted that they only moved in together in 2008. However, there are questions about where Ed lived between selling his home in 2005 and buying in Chalcot Road the following year. Up until 2008 Justine owned her own apartment in nearby Maida Vale. Had the couple been married and living together only one property would have been able to be classed as a primary residence – the other would have been a second home and as such any gains made on it would have incurred capital gains tax after a period. But because they were not married and apparently not living together there would have been no tax to pay. The Maida Vale home was sold in March 2008. It was only at this point that the couple apparently moved in together, into Mr Miliband’s Chalcot Road home. They eventually moved into a home bought by Justine in July 2009. Ed sold his Chalcot Road flat in 2009, five months after Justine bought their current home. He would have had 18 months to do this before capital gains tax applies.",MPs want Ed Miliband to explain his family's complicated  property history .

"A British soldier has been found dead in a street in Miami while on holiday for a dance music festival. The 22-year-old, named locally as Private Shaun Cole, was on holiday in the city in Florida when it is thought he suffered a trauma to his head, caused by a blunt instrument.. His body was discovered by a shopper early Sunday morning, and a major investigation has now been launched to establish how he died. The body of Private Shaun Cole was found by a shopper in a Miami street on Sunday. A member of the Royal Scot Borderers, he had recently returned from a military operation in Sierra Leone to help support the fight against Ebola . Eyewitnesses reported seeing the Scottish soldier, who had served two tours in Afghanistan, running along the street with blood pouring from his head before collapsing in a heap. He had recently returned from a tour of Sierra Leone in west Africa, supporting the fight against Ebola. Miami resident Oscar Aguilera, who found Private Cole's body, said: 'When I saw him not moving and a puddle of blood, yeah, I kind of knew he wasn't doing all right. 'It's not the best way to start a Sunday.' The 22-year-old had been staying at in room 9 of nearby Royal Budget Inn, a cheap motel in a run down area of Miami, for the weekend with two friends. The sprawling urban area is a known hot spot for drugs and cheap roadside accommodation, and the street where his body was discovered has now been cordoned off by police hunting for clues. Officers are also making enquiries at the motel, according to The Daily Record, while the owner of the hotel Mrs Patel told local media that Private Cole had died from a blunt trauma to the head.
