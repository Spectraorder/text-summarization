"At least nine people have died in clashes between protesters and police Turkey as demonstrations against ISIS's advance on a town on the Syrian-Turkish border turned violent. Turkey's pro-Kurdish Peoples' Democratic Party had called for citizens to protest the assault on Kobane, where the situation turned 'extremely critical' overnight. Officers were forced to use tear gas and water cannons to disperse protesters in Turkey's predominantly Kurdish eastern and southeastern provinces, as well as the capital Ankara and in Istanbul, where cars were set on fire and demonstrators threw rocks and fireworks at police.

Two people died in southeastern Siirt province, the governor was quoted as saying by CNN Turk Television, and another died in neighbouring Batman. Curfews were imposed in five predominantly Kurdish southeastern provinces after the protests, in which shops and banks were damaged. Interior Minister Efkan Ala called for an end to the protests. 'Violence is not the solution. Violence triggers reprisals. This irrational attitude should come to an end immediately,' he told reporters.

Some European countries are arming the Kurds, and the American-led coalition is carrying out airstrikes against the Islamic extremists, but protesters say it is not enough. Tensions are especially high in Turkey, where Kurds have fought a three-decade-long battle for autonomy and where Syria's violence has taken an especially heavy toll. Protests were reported in cities across Turkey on Tuesday, after ISIS fighters backed by tanks and artillery engaged in heavy street battles in Kobane. Police used water cannons and tear gas to disperse demonstrators in Istanbul and in the desert town of Kucuk Kenderciler, near Kobane on the Turkish side of the border. One person in Istanbul was hospitalized after being hit in the head by a gas canister, Dogan reported. Some protesters shouted 'Murderer ISIS!' and accused Turkey's government of collaborating with the Islamic militants. Authorities declared a curfew in six towns in the southeastern province of Mardin, the Anadolu Agency reported. Hundreds of thousands of Kurds live elsewhere in Europe, and mobilized quickly via social networks to stage protests after the advance on Kobane.

In Germany, home to Western Europe's largest Kurdish population, about 600 people demonstrated in Berlin on Tuesday, according to police. Hundreds demonstrated in other German cities. Austria, too, saw protests. Kurds peacefully occupied the Dutch Parliament for several hours Monday night, and met Tuesday with legislators to press for more Dutch action against the insurgents, according to local media.

Kurds protested overnight at the French Parliament and plan another protest Tuesday. Kurds also staged impromptu protests against the Islamic State fighters in Helsinki, Oslo and Stockholm. On Monday, protesters at the U.S. Embassy in Cyprus urged the international coalition to provide heavy weaponry to Kurdish fighters and forge a military cooperation pact with the Kurdish group YPG.","At least nine people dead in protests across Turkey on Tuesday .

"A group of dancers move with perfect grace and precision, their beautiful diaphanous gowns catching the light with every pirouette and leap. The English National Ballet's new production of Swan Lake, seen here in final dress rehearsal before opening tonight, is bringing the magic of the classic Tchaikovsky work back to London.

Romanian-born Alina is a principal dancer with the English National Ballet after leaving the Royal Ballet in 2013. Tamara Rojo, 40, is the ballet company's artistic director, and recently dispelled the myth that the two dancers were bitter rivals. 'I think that is one of those myths, like ballet being an elite art,” she told the Telegraph. 'I think what people don’t understand is that your biggest rival is always yourself. It is your own perceived limitations that keep you wanting to do more and do better.' One swan stretches out gracefully on the stage floor in the magical tale of transformation and loss . In the ballet the swans are women under an enchantment that can only be broken by a prince's pure love . With classic tutus, on pointe, the English National Ballet is going back to Swan Lake's classical roots . In Swan Lake, Prince Siegfried turns 21 and out hunting meets Odette, a beautiful woman who's been turned into a swan by an evil sorcerer Rothbart. Only his pure love can save her she tells him yet before he can do anything, the women are compelled to dance as swans by the lake far from the prince's reach. The ballet inspired the film Black Swan starring Natalie Portman as the dancer driven insane by the demands of the role. Swan Lake was premiered by Russia's Bolshoi ballet in Moscow in 1877.

"Madrid, Spain (CNN) -- Hundreds of runners braved their luck Wednesday on the first day of the annual running of the bulls in Pamplona -- but just two men, an Australian and a Spaniard, were taken to hospital afterward with injuries, the Navarra regional government said. It was considered a thrilling but safe start to the annual tradition in Pamplona, which has tallied 14 deaths since record-keeping began in 1924, including the fatal goring of a Spanish man last year, and thousands of injuries. The run in Pamplona started 400 years ago and became popular worldwide after author Ernest Hemingway wrote about it in the 1920s in his book ""The Sun Also Rises,"" also published under the title ""Fiesta."" It is now broadcast live across Spain by state television TVE, which estimated there were more than a thousand runners. An 18-year-old Australian man from Melbourne was taken to hospital with various injuries sustained on the narrow street that descends into the bullring. And a Spanish man, 20, from Zaragoza also went to hospital with an eye injury sustained on a street almost halfway through the run, the Navarra regional government said on its website. Both were initially listed in stable condition but under close observation, the website said. It took the six bulls and a pack of tame steers, which help guide the bulls, a full 17 seconds to emerge from the corrals after the opening rocket was fired to signal the start of the run. But the pack then moved swiftly through the cobblestone streets of old Pamplona along the 825-meter (902-yard) course to the bullring, where the bulls will die later in the day in a bullfight. The run lasted just 2 minutes and 23 seconds and the bull and steer pack stayed mainly together, which long-time observers say usually means a safer run -- unlike when a bull or bulls get separated, frightened and may charge directly into the runners. Television images showed mostly men dressed in the traditional white outfits with red handkerchiefs, but also a small number of women, and even one man with a football helmet, which is prohibited but was apparently not noticed by the hundreds of police officers who eject, before the run, people carrying cameras or who are drunk. The aim is safety, so that runners can focus on the run. Television images showed numerous runners making hard falls to the pavement, tripping over other runners or colliding with the bulls. The daily run continues for eight days, through July 14, at 8 a.m. (2 a.m. ET), and is the highlight of the San Fermin festival in Pamplona that attracts hundreds of thousands to the non-stop fiesta.","1 Austrialian, 1 Spaniard taken to hospital .

"Ed Miliband was facing a backbench revolt last night over Labour’s failure to support a judge-led inquiry into British complicity in torture. The party’s high command still insists a Westminster committee should investigate even though it presided over an alleged whitewash in the extraordinary rendition affair. A string of Mr Miliband’s MPs yesterday declared that disturbing questions raised by a US Senate report on the barbaric treatment of detainees by the CIA should be answered once and for all. Paul Flynn, David Winnick and Yasmin Qureshi all said only a judge-led process would do. Scroll down for video . Ed Miliband was facing a backbench revolt last night over Labour’s failure to support a judge-led inquiry into British complicity in torture . It leaves Labour’s leader in the unusual position of backing an investigation he himself admits may be inadequate. His brother David could even be called to give evidence to any inquiry. As foreign secretary from 2007 to 2010, he is accused of trying to cover up Britain’s involvement in CIA wrongdoing. Other Labour figures facing questions include Jack Straw and Tony Blair, who broke cover yesterday to say he had never condoned torture. On another day of drama at Westminster: . A string of Mr Miliband’s MPs declared only a probe by a judge could clear up the disturbing questions raised by a US Senate report on the barbaric treatment of detainees by the CIA. Both Paul Flynn (left) and David Winnick (right) said past mistakes should not be covered up . Yvette Cooper said on Sunday that she doubted Parliament’s intelligence and security committee had the capacity and the scope to carry out an inquiry and her ‘instinct’ was for a judge-led process. However, the shadow home secretary then stopped short of backing the full judicial investigation sought by MPs on all sides. Last night a source close to Mr Miliband said: ‘Ed agrees with the position set out by Yvette. The Government has outlined that the intelligence committee will be doing it, we have some concerns on it but we need to see the way the Government sets that out. As foreign secretary from 2007 to 2010, David Miliband is accused of trying to cover up Britain’s involvement in CIA wrongdoing . ‘We are not at this stage calling for anything to go further than that.’ Yesterday Mrs May said that, since her appointment in 2010, she had seen no evidence of the security services being complicit in ill treatment. But, turning the spotlight on the New Labour years, she added: ‘I cannot speak for what might have happened in the past before this Government came into office.’ Mr Clegg also spoke out, saying senior figures in the last Labour government should give evidence on what they knew. The Deputy Prime Minister added: ‘If people are found to have broken the law, the full weight of the law should come down on them without fear or favour, however operationally grand they are.’ When Mrs May appeared before the home affairs committee, Labour MPs took the opportunity to call for a judge-led investigation. Mr Flynn said it was time for Britain – which is still to publish the Chilcot report into the Iraq War – to ‘get away from this policy of trying to cover up past mistakes’. He added: ‘The (Senate torture) report degrades our reputation as allies of the United States.’ Other Labour MPs demanding a judicial inquiry included Mr Winnick and Miss Qureshi. Mr Winnick said an investigation by a judge was needed to ‘clear this whole matter up once and for all’. Keith Vaz, the committee’s chairman, stopped short of calling for a judge-led inquiry, but said it looks like being the next stage. The Labour MP added: ‘The status quo is not going to be enough.’ Mrs May came under pressure to explain the extent to which Britain had lobbied to have the Senate intelligence committee report – which detailed CIA beatings, waterboarding and the rectal feeding of detainees – redacted. It had been stripped of any mention of MI5, MI6 or Diego Garcia – the British base which David Miliband belatedly admitted had been used for at least two rendition flights. As the Mail revealed last week, there were 22 meetings between the Senate committee and British ambassadors. Mrs May also personally met its chairman Dianne Feinstein, though not on the date originally given by the Foreign Office. The Home Secretary said she had not personally asked for any of the report to be redacted, and the pair had discussed ‘other things’. A number of celebrities and politicians have signed a letter to David Cameron demanding Shaker Aamer’s release from Guantanamo Bay. The father of four is pictured here with two of his children . Other Labour figures facing questions are Jack Straw (left) and Tony Blair (right), who broke cover yesterday to say he had never condoned torture . But she conceded: ‘The UK had an opportunity to ensure there was no evidence put in which would damage our national security.’ Despite the growing clamour on all sides for a judicial inquiry, Mrs May said she also believed the intelligence and security committee should be allowed to complete the task. MPs have voiced concerns that the committee – which cleared MI5 and MI6 of involvement in extraordinary rendition in 2007 – does not have sufficient powers. ISC chairman Sir Malcolm Rifkind has said he will ask the US Senate to reveal which parts of its damning report the British Government asked to be redacted from the published version. However, other members of the UK committee have questioned why he does not simply request the information from British authorities rather than go down the time-consuming road of negotiating with the US. Mr Blair’s office issued a statement saying: ‘Tony Blair has always been opposed to the use of torture, has always said so publicly and privately, has never condoned its use and – as is shown by internal government documentation already made public – thinks it is totally unacceptable.’ The statement did not address any of the specific allegations that – during the war on terror – British agents were complicit in extraordinary rendition or had turned a blind eye to abuse of detainees. David Miliband and Mr Straw were unavailable for comment last night. Last week Ed Miliband leapt to the defence of his brother, saying he would ‘never’ have knowingly allowed British agents to become involved in rendition and torture programmes run by the CIA.",Labour high command insists Westminster committee should investigate .

"By . James Rush . PUBLISHED: . 21:58 EST, 14 January 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 11:06 EST, 15 January 2013 . The grandmother of eight-year-old Imani Green, who was shot dead in a Jamaican grocery store while on holiday, has described finding her granddaughter in a 'pool of blood'. Sandra Fisher, who lives in the northern Jamaican village Duncans, described the brutal aftermath of the shooting on Friday. She said: 'My two little granddaughters were there and when one came back I said ‘where is the baby’. 'We went to the shop and I saw a little girl lying down in a pool of blood. I started to cry and everyone was crying and saying ‘why did they kill the little girl?’ Crying: The grandmother of British schoolgirl Imani Green, who was killed on Friday in Jamaica, said she found her granddaughter's body. Imani, pictured right with her mother Donna in 2009, was on holiday to help alleviate the symptoms of sickle cell anaemia . She added: 'She is such a pleasant child; she is the daughter of my son who migrated to England around seven years ago.' Imani had been allowed to take an . extended break from her South London school to visit the country in the . hope that it would help alleviate the symptoms of her sickle-cell . anaemia. Horrifying: Imani Green's grandmother Sandra Fisher, who lives in Duncans, Jamaica, said she found the eight-year-old in a 'pool of blood' She was shot in the head and shoulder when a masked gunman opened fire in the roadside shop and bar run by her cousin. The girl's cousin Brandese Brown, a witness to the incident, told ITN: 'I could see the shot coming out of the gun, just a spear of fire.' She said that the gunman had been wearing a hood at the time. Eight suspects have been 'intensively interrogated' by police over her murder. The island's authorities have said they are confident of solving the killing. One line of inquiry is that Imani was the innocent victim of gangsters fighting a turf war over an illegal lottery scam, according to Jamaica's Security Minister Peter Bunting. The scam, which targets elderly . Americans in the hope that they will wire money to Jamaica after being . told they have won the lottery, is thought to have earned Jamaican gangs . £50 million (£31.8m) last year. Around 500 deaths have been linked to . the scam, while it is also though to account for around half of the . violent crime in the area where Imani was shot. A second person was last night shot dead in . the village, half a mile from a roadside cafe . where Imani was killed on Friday. Following the incident, hundreds of stunned locals yesterday gathered at the scene. A police cordon was in place at the scene, where bullet holes could be seen in a silver Toyota Corolla. Imani, pictured in 2009, is believed to have been the innocent victim of gangsters fighting a turf war over an illegal lottery scam . Heartbroken: Sandra Fisher with relatives, including Imani's brother Tyrese Green, second right in Duncans, Trelawny, Jamaica . Sources believe the gunman could be the same man who killed Imani and wounded three of her cousins. One said the victim's first name was Xavier, although this has not been confirmed. One resident, who did not want to be . identified, said: 'People are whispering that he knew too much - he knew . who killed the little girl. That's why he got shot.' Detectives have confirmed they are investigating whether the latest shooting is connected to Imani's death and say they are not ruling out any possibilities. Detectives are investigating whether the latest shooting in the Jamaican village of Duncans was connected to Imani's death . Detective Superintendent Anthony McLaughlin, of Trelawny Parish Police, said: 'Our scenes of crime officers are still down there examining the scene, it's too early for us to say what is behind this.' He said the victim had not yet been identified. Det Supt McLaughlin said: 'We are looking at whether the two recent deaths in Duncans are linked. To have two shootings within three days in this community is very unusual.' Deputy Superintendent Steve Brown, from the Jamaica Constabulary Force, said the eight suspects in the first shooting, all men under 35, were being questioned but dismissed suggestions linking the shooting to gang warfare.

"(CNN) -- Davy Jones, whose charming grin and British accent won the hearts of millions of fans on the 1960s television series ""The Monkees,"" died Wednesday, according to the Martin County, Florida, sheriff's office. He was 66. A witness told authorities he was with Jones in Indiantown, Florida, when Jones ""began to complain of not feeling well and having trouble breathing,"" the sheriff's office said in a statement. Jones was transported to a hospital, where he was pronounced dead, authorities said. A Martin County law enforcement source with knowledge of the case said Jones apparently suffered a heart attack. Laurie Jacobson, whose company Living Legends LTD often booked Jones for Hollywood nostalgia shows, spoke with him two days ago about several new bookings. ""He was a vegetarian, and there was not an ounce of fat on the guy,"" Jacobson said. ""He lived on the beach in Florida and ran miles every morning. This is the last person I expected this to happen to. He couldn't have been in better shape."" The diminutive vocalist and actor sang lead on the musical group's hits such as ""Daydream Believer"" and ""A Little Bit Me, A Little Bit You."" Besides Jones, The Monkees included band members Micky Dolenz, Peter Tork and Michael Nesmith. The pop group was created to star in an NBC sitcom and capitalize on the Beatles' teenybopper popularity. ""The Monkees"" TV series premiered in the fall of 1966. Share your memories of Davy Jones on iReport . In terms of musical popularity, the project succeeded beyond anyone's expectations, with the group notching a handful of No. 1 songs (including ""I'm a Believer,"" Billboard's top song of 1967) and four No. 1 albums. The group, which was dubbed the ""prefab four"" by critics, rebelled against its management in an effort to take control of its musical career. The move worked to an extent -- band members, who had generally been replaced by session men on Monkees recordings, were allowed to play their own instruments and contribute songs -- but coincided with a decline in the Monkees' popularity. NBC canceled the TV series ""The Monkees"" after just two seasons, and the band lasted for only one more year after that. Though the TV show was never a huge ratings hit, its knockabout, Marx Brothers-style comedy -- inspired, to an extent, by the loopier sequences in the Beatles' ""A Hard Day's Night"" -- gained fans and followers, reigniting the band's popularity when MTV reran the show in the mid-'80s. Demand for Jones at nostalgia shows was brisk, Jacobson said. ""He's been really busy,"" she said. ""He's toured with his band, singing as well. He loved to pick up these little autograph shows. He loved the fans, he loved spending time with his fans. He often got on stage and performed at these shows. The lines for him were always out the door."" The Hollywood Chamber of Commerce said flowers in honor of Jones would be placed on The Monkees' star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame on Wednesday afternoon. ""That David has stepped beyond my view causes me the sadness that it does many of you,"" Nesmith posted on his Facebook page Wednesday. ""I will miss him, but I won't abandon him to mortality ... David's spirit and soul live well in my heart, among all the lovely people, who remember with me the good times, and the healing times, that were created for so many, including us."" ""His talent will be much missed; his gifts will be with us always,"" said fellow Monkee Peter Tork. ""My deepest sympathy to Jessica and the rest of his family."" Beatle Ringo Starr issued a short statement: ""God bless Davy. Peace & love to his family, Ringo."" David Thomas Jones was born December 30, 1945, in Manchester, England. He was already famous in his home country when he joined the Monkees. He had starred in the musical ""Oliver!"" on the London stage as the Artful Dodger and was nominated for a Tony for his performance on Broadway, according to a biography on a Monkees fan site. Indeed, he got a taste of the Beatles' popularity when the ""Oliver!"" cast appeared on ""The Ed Sullivan Show"" on February 9, 1964 -- the date of the Beatles' first appearance. After the Monkees broke up, Jones enjoyed occasional acting roles, including a guest spot on an episode of ""The Brady Bunch"" and appearances in ""SpongeBob SquarePants"" and ""The Brady Bunch Movie."" When he wasn't singing -- he participated in several Monkees reunions over the years -- he was devoted to owning and racing horses. Jones was married three times.

"Opinion: Seth Rogen caused a Twitter storm with a tweet about American Sniper . Hollywood actors continue to fire Twitter salvos at each other over actor Seth Rogen’s controversial tweet about movie American Sniper, based on Navy SEAL Chris Kyle’s experiences in Iraq. He wrote that the movie reminded him of a Nazi propaganda film about a sniper that appeared in Quentin Tarantino’s acclaimed Inglorious Basterds. Such is the furore surrounding the tweet that he felt obliged to further clarify his comments with another tweet underlining that he has nothing against war veterans and was not comparing the movie to Nazi propaganda. Now Alec Baldwin has leapt to the defence of the Neighbors actor, after Dean Cain weighed in with a tweet claiming that he had no right to make the comment in the original tweet because he’d never fought in a war. Cain, known for his role as Superman, wrote: ‘Seth... I like your films, but right now, I wanna kick your ass. Chris is an American Hero. Period. Go to war. Then we'll talk.’ However, Baldwin retorted: ‘Did @RealDeanCain threaten Seth Rogen? And isn't that the same kind of troubled thinking that got Chris Kyle killed?’ The Clint Eastwood film is a profile of Kyle, who was described as the most lethal sniper in U.S. military history. While critical reviews have been generally positive and the movie has been nominated for Academy Awards for Best Picture and Best Actor, it has also drawn fire for being jingoistic or propaganda for the U.S. military. Filmmaker Michael Moore caused an online debate when he tweeted about how he was raised to believe snipers were 'cowards' since his uncle died by a Japanese sniper shot in World War II. Taking to Twitter in rage, the Fahrenheit 9/11 director seethed: 'My uncle killed by sniper in WW2. We were taught snipers were cowards. Will shoot u in the back. Snipers aren't heroes. And invaders r worse.' Moore later backtracked those comments on Facebook, writing that he thought the film was well made but could have done a better job at contextualizing the Iraq War. Rogen has now also sought to calm the Twitter storm down with another explanation of his tweet sent on January 19 that referenced the Nazi sniper. He wrote: ‘It appears I need to further clarify a tweet I sent a few days ago. I said a sniper movie kind of reminded me of a scene in another movie that involved a sniper movie. I didn't compare the two at all. I merely said that one kind of reminded me of the other, because they both involved plots about the most lethal of snipers. Scroll down for video . Alec Baldwin (left) defended Seth Rogen after Dean Cain (right) accused the Neighbors actor of having no right to tweet his remarks about American Sniper because he'd never been to war . This is what I really meant: Seth Rogen went online to clarify the difference between 'kinda reminded me' and a direct comparison. He used apples and oranges as an example . ‘People then claimed that I compared the movie American Sniper to Nazi propaganda, something I would never do (I've already publicly explained that I enjoyed American Sniper) and also implied that I somehow have something against Chris Kyle and veterans in general, neither of which are true in the least. ‘My grandfather was a veteran. My comment about the movie was not meant to have any political implications. Any political meaning was ascribed to my comment by news commentary. I'm sorry if this somehow offended anyone, but that was not my intention. I hope this clears things up.’ This follows an earlier attempt at clarification. Rogen insisted on that occasion as well that he wasn't comparing American Sniper with the parody vignette in Inglorious Basterds, but was saying that one reminded him of the other. He tweeted: ‘Apples remind me of oranges. Can't compare them though.' Rogen, 32, then threw in a small dig at the media, accusing the press of blowing his opinions 'out of proportion'. The Interview star wrote that he is happy to keep the fires burning on the controversy. Quentin Tarantino's Inglorius Basterds culminates with an assassination attempt on Adolph Hitler at the premiere of a fictional propaganda film called 'Stolz der Nation' which translates to Nation's Pride. One of the characters of the film is a haughty German soldier who plays himself in Nation's Pride, a movie about how he killed 200 Allied soldiers from a clock tower in one battle. Controversy: Rogen said American Sniper (still on the right) reminded him of Nation's Pride (still on the left), a fake Nazi propaganda film from Quentin Tarantino's World War II film Inglorious Basterds . True story: American Sniper is based on Chris Kyle's memoir, which was written before his tragic death in February 2013 at a shooting range . Oscar-tipped: Clint Eastwood's (left) movie is hotly-tipped to pick up a few Oscars, including Best Actor for Cooper (right) American Sniper on the other hand stars Bradley Cooper as Chris Kyle, the real-life man who became the deadliest sniper in U.S. military history, saving hundreds of American lives with at least 160 kills. The film, based on Kyle's memoir, ends with his tragic death in Texas, allegedly at the hands of a fellow soldier with PTSD he was trying to help. Kid Rock was one of the first stars to wade in on the debate stirred up by Rogen and Moore, tweeting: ‘: 'F— you Michael Moore, you’re a piece of s— and your uncle would be ashamed of you. Seth Rogen, your uncle probably molested you. I hope both of you catch a fist to the face soon. 'God bless you Chris Kyle, Thank you for your service.' American Sniper,  directed by Clint Eastwood, raked in $105.3million during its opening weekend in America.","Seth Rogen caused a Twitter storm with a tweet about American Sniper .

"Wisconsin Gov. and rising Republican star Scott Walker refused on Wednesday to say whether he believes in evolution during a Q and A at a London think tank. After declining to answer numerous questions related to foreign policy, out of respect for the sitting President of the United States, the likely presidential candidate evaded the event moderator's question about evolution, telling him, 'For me, I am going to punt on that one as well.' 'That's a question a politician shouldn't be involved in one way or the other,' he added. Scroll down for video . 'That's a question a politician shouldn't be involved in one way or the other,' Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker said of evolution on Wednesday during an appearance at London-based think tank Chatham House . Even after his interviewer, Justin Webb of BBC Radio 4, asserted that 'any British politician right or left wing would laugh and say, ""yes of course evolution's true,"" ' Walked stood his ground. 'I'm here to talk about trade, not to pontificate on other issues,' he said, heartily adding, to laughter, 'I love the issue of trade in Wisconsin.' Recently elected to his second term as governor in The Badger State after surviving a recall challenge in his first term, Walker is now on the path to the GOP nomination for president. He has been making the rounds in early presidential states such as Iowa, where he reportedly leased office space this week, and is currently on a trip to the U.K. After fellow presumed Republican presidential contender Chris Christie's disastrous trip to England last week that involved the cancellation of several press conferences after the New Jersey politician came under attack in the U.S. for his lavish spending and his position on mandatory vaccinations, Walker's team said the Wisconsin governor would take no questions from reporters while abroad. The only exception was to be today's speech at Chatham House, an international affairs institute, followed by a sit down interview with Webb. But even then, Walker was not inclined to give direct answers to many of the questions put before him, according to reporters present. The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel said Walker excused himself from commenting on world affairs because he holds the 'old-fashioned' view that it's not appropriate  to 'talk about foreign policy while you're on foreign soil.' 'I don't think it's wise to undermine your own president' on trips such as these, he later said. Officially in Britain as part of a taxpayer-funded trade mission, the UK visit is widely seen as an opportunity for Walker to bulk up his foreign policy credentials before he formally announces a presidential bid. On Tuesday the Republican governor met with British Prime Minister David Cameron. Today he paid a visit to the speaker of the House of Commons, John Bercow. During the trip he also visited a Harley-Davidson dealership - the company was founded in Wisconsin, and stopped by the grave of British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, a conservative icon, to pay his respects. Walker is pictured leaving 10 Downing street after a private meeting with British Prime Minister David Cameron in London on Tuesday. Walker is leading a coalition of Wisconsin government and business officials on a trade mission that runs until Friday. The trip gives him a chance to bolster his overseas and foreign policy credentials as he considers running for president in 2016 . Walker is not alone among the probable GOP presidential candidates in his hesitancy to take a stance on evolution. Former governors Rick Perry of Texas and Bobby Jindal of Louisiana have both waffled when asked about the scientific origins of creation. Christie has also been won't to discuss the subject or anything related to foreign policy. Still, the Democratic National Committee took a shot at Walker on Wednesday afternoon over the ducking and dodging. 'For someone who went to London to build his street cred as a serious leader all Walker showed today was the same ducking and dodging Wisconsinites know all too well and that we’ve come to expect from the 2016 GOP field, whose policy positions are just too divisive to share,' the DNC's National Press Secretary, Holly Shulman, said in an email to reporters. 'Would’ve been a lot simpler to just stay home,' she added. In a separate email later in the day, DNC Communications Director Mo Elleithee trolled the Republican field and asked, 'Do any other GOP presidential candidates want to go to London? 'If so, let us know. The DNC is more than happy to pick up your travel costs,' Elleithee said.","'That's a question a politician shouldn't be involved in one way or the other,' Walker said during an appearance at Chatham House .

"Shedding light on the woes of the upper middle, the 'Overheard in Waitrose' Facebook page took the internet by storm. Infants were heard pining for star fruit and lychees, as mothers barked: 'Noah! You've had enough Manchego for one day!' But now, as hard-up families turn to budget rivals, a version has been made for the cut-price alternative: Aldi. Scroll down for video . Not quite: Aldi may offer everything from chips to soya milk on the cheap, but this shopper seems confused . Change: After internet users flocked to read Waitrose shoppers comments, an Aldi version is becoming a hit . Poking fun: The page pokes fun at the bargain supermarket that has been snapping up shoppers from its rivals . Winning shoppers: The cut-price supermarket has become a hit with the ethos 'spend a little, live a lot' Instead of poking fun at the cushioned lives of Waitrose customers, Overheard In Aldi's collection of comical comments depict a more downmarket shopper. One post on the site, which has more than 2,000 'likes', reads: 'This place is fantastic value for money, I got a shopping trolley that was on display outside for £1. Bargain.' Another adds: 'Chantelle put that f****** vodka back you already got a bottle for ya 16th birthday last week!!' The company, with its no frills approach and low prices, has seen sales rise by 31.5 per cent, massively outpacing the big four of Tesco, Asda, Sainsbury’s and Morrisons. Aldi has made huge efforts to attract Middle Britain shoppers by introducing a range of superior products at budget prices from fine wines and spirits, to coffee, olive oil, Aberdeen Angus steaks and even fresh goose for Christmas. The group slims down its overheads and profit margins to the minimum with minimalist stores, fewer staff and charges for plastic bags. Confused: Compared to the Waitrose version, quotes on the Aldi page are not littered with elaborate words . Shoppers: One commenter used the format of Flo-Rida's song Low to describe the typical Aldi shopper . Dialect: While most of the Waitrose quotes have a posh air, Aldi's shoppers  speak in local dialects . Significantly, . it does not stock any of the big brands, like Kellogg’s and Heinz, . however it has run into trouble for creating its own cheaper copycat . versions. Its . approach has proved popular because of the resulting low prices which . appeal to a nation suffering the longest and deepest cut in incomes and . living standards ever recorded. The . low prices do not mean poor quality or taste. Just last week the . supermarket won 16 gold medals and another 10 silvers in an annual test . to find the nation’s best own-label supermarket foods. The . webpage also features a conversation between two shoppers who struggle . with simple maths and get confused by half price offers. There . is also a conversation in which a youngster asks their dad to buy them . cigarettes, but he replies: 'Nah forgot my fake ID'. Another post about an aubergine sees a boy ask his mum if the vegetable is a cucumber, to which she answers: 'No, it’s a courgette dumb s***.' It is a stark contrast from Overheard in Waitrose, which paints a picture of shoppers whose wealth has left them out of touch with everyday lives. Popular: It seems the group is a response to the Waitrose page as Aldi continues to soar in popularity . Cut-price: Aldi has gained a name for winning customers with bargains - and it seems that's all they come for . One child was overheard asking his mum if they were 'doing shopping for the boat as well'. Another . parent was reported telling her son: 'Lucas put that falafel down, you . already chose olives with Manchego for your treat.' According . to the Facebook page, one couple in the Newark branch in . Nottinghamshire who spotted another customer with an Asda shopping bag . said to each other: 'Should she be walking around in here with that?' And after a Waitrose butcher told a woman they had run out of fillet steak but she could have topside instead, she replied: 'Topside? Why on earth would we feed Winnie topside? Bespoke: Waitrose is the darling of the upmarket shopper serving the sturdy middle and upper classes . Children in Waitrose clearly have different tastes to those whose parents shop in less exclusive supermarkets . Nightmare: Waitrose customers can hardly imagine the horror of running out of such culinary essentials . 'Anyone would think you wanted to kill the poor dog.' (To this, one Facebook user replied: 'You have to work at Waitrose, as I did for 27 years, to know that comments like this are not fictitious.') A customer in the Wilmslow, Cheshire, branch was overheard telling her husband: 'Please don't rummage in the reduced bin, darling, someone from the golf club might see you.'

'Once these young men cross over that line they become enemies of Australia and the world,' he told reporters in Sydney on Saturday. The brothers' family is reported to be devastated by the news. 'These four young men have effectively been indoctrinated by... a death cult,' the minister said. Mr Morrison said authorities had received the tip too late to apprehend them. The siblings were 'clean-skins' and had not been on any watch-lists. 'These were people for whom nothing indicated to date that they might be involved in this type of activity,' Mr Morrison said. He said it was important the community provided information to authorities. There are now more than 60 Australians known to be fighting in foreign conflicts.

Authorities argue they need more tools to monitor suspects and prevent them from being radicalised . As authorities attempt to contain home-grown terrorists  from leaving the country, the latest recruits from Western Sydney have been labelled 'cleanskins' by police agencies because they were completely unknown to intelligence. Australian Federal Police commissioner Neil Gaughan told a parliamentary committee on Thursday that the group of four that managed to leave the country this week were 'not on anyone's radar', the Guardian reported. 'We got wind of it after the fact, but the fact is there are still people travelling,' said Gaughan, the national manager of counter-terrorism for the Australian Federal Police. 1 .

'Australia has lost yet another four young kids. This is why we are so adamant in trying to prevent people leaving to join these foreign fighters', Mr Morrison told The Daily Telegraph. It follows after 'ginger' jihadist Abdullah Elmir disappeared from his Bankstown home in Sydney's south-west in June and made his way to the Middle East. The 17-year-old gained notoriety when he declared that ISIS will not stop their murderous campaign 'until the black flag is flying high in every single land' in the YouTube video. Khaled Sharrouf is also fighting with IS militants in the Middle East, and made headlines when he posted a photo of his young son brandishing a severed head .

This comes just days ahead of the G20 summit to be held in Brisbane, which will be attended by a large number of world leaders. Police commissioner Neil Gaughan also told the committee he believed that federal police officers needed greater controls urgently, so they were better able to track the movements and interactions of suspects. 'But the fact is there’s still people travelling and regardless of what we’re doing, we’re not stopping that so we need some other tools,' he said, according to The Telegraph. Though he did not reveal from where or to what destination the group travelled, Gaughan said officers are now virtually powerless to stop them unless they resurface elsewhere.

"(CNN) -- Texas Gov. Rick Perry's suggestion that the United States may send troops to fight Mexican drug cartels riled officials and spurred debate from analysts on both sides of the border Monday. Mexico's top representative in the United States rejected the idea, which the Republican presidential candidate mentioned at a New Hampshire campaign stop Saturday. Mexican Ambassador Arturo Sarukhan told reporters his country's longstanding opposition to the presence of American forces had not changed. ""The matter of the participation or presence of U.S. troops on Mexican soil is not on the table,"" Sarukhan said Monday. ""It is not a component that forms part of the innovative approaches that Mexico and the United States have been using to confront transnational organized crime."" Perry said Saturday that leaders from Mexico and the United States should meet after next year's elections to address the deadly drug trade. ""It may require our military in Mexico working in concert with them to kill these drug cartels and to keep them off of our border,"" he said. Analysts in the United States and Mexico said the controversial idea could have significant political consequences and security implications -- even as a political campaign proposal. ""It may be well-intentioned, but it has the potential of really undermining cooperation between the U.S. and Mexico,"" said Eric L. Olson, who studies security relationships between the neighboring countries at the Mexico Institute of the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars in Washington. The United States admits its drug market plays a role in fueling violence in Mexico, and has pledged $1.4 billion in assistance through the so-called Merida Initiative, which includes programs to help train Mexican military, police and justice officials. ""If there's a perception in Mexico that this is all designed somehow as a backdoor entry into Mexico by the U.S., if there's a perception that this is leading to the United States' direct intervention into Mexico, it puts at risk all those cooperative efforts,"" Olson said. George W. Grayson -- author of ""Mexico: Narco-Violence and a Failed State?"" -- described Perry's proposal as ""absolute, unadulterated nonsense."" ""The first thing you'd have to fight is the Mexican Army if you sent troops in there. It's ludicrous,"" he said. Even if they don't gain traction, Perry's comments will likely resonate in campaign rhetoric beyond the United States' borders, as presidential campaigns in Mexico are also kicking into high gear, Grayson said. ""Typically this is a time of nationalism and breast-beating by candidates. ... The politicians are the ones who are going to walk all over it. They're going to say, 'See, the gringos are coming after us,'"" he said. Several Mexican lawmakers -- who the country's constitution says would need to approve any presence of U.S. soldiers -- expressed concern about Perry's comments Monday. Institutional Revolutionary Party Sen. Maria de los Angeles Moreno said U.S. troops in Mexico would be a clear ""aggression."" ""We must make an effort to face our own challenge, the violence of the criminals and the organized crime groups, but with our own forces and always maintaining the control of our territory,"" said Sen. Carlos Navarrete of the left-wing Democratic Revolution Party. But security analyst Pablo Monzalvo said when it comes to U.S. involvement, some Mexican officials are prone to double speak -- allowing U.S.-led measures to occur even as they speak out against them. Earlier this year Mexico's foreign minister fielded questions from angry lawmakers who said U.S. surveillance of Mexican territory -- aimed at detecting criminal groups -- was illegal. ""There is interference...and this has been said publicly. But I ask myself what has been accomplished by ceding a certain amount of authority,"" Monzalvo said. Perry, who was first elected governor of Texas in 2002, has faced criticism from opponents who have attacked his conservative bona fides on illegal immigration at a series of debates this fall. ""He's trying to compensate and say, 'Yeah, I'm really tough on Mexico,' but I think he's overcompensated,"" said Grayson, who is also a professor of government at the College of William and Mary in Williamsburg, Virginia. This isn't the first time Perry has called for greater force fighting drug cartels. Last year he asked U.S. President Barack Obama to send 1,000 additional National Guard troops to the border. ""We must show the cartels that Washington will no longer tolerate their terrorizing and criminalizing the border region,"" he wrote in a letter to the president. Troops crossing the border, however, is a different matter, Olson said. ""No Mexican wants the U.S. to send its military troops. ...

"(CNN) -- You can draw your own conclusions about why Jill Abramson was fired, but as we look at the history of her tenure as executive editor of The New York Times, the world's most prestigious and influential newspaper, and learn details about how it came to an end, women everywhere are shaking their heads. Any woman who has spent time in the work force is familiar with the challenges of being judged and treated fairly by her peers and bosses, of obtaining the recognition she deserves, and of being an effective advocate for one's own career. Women battle to break through the glass ceiling. After that, what comes is walking on broken glass. It's popular now to talk about the need for women to lean in. But, that's not even half the battle. Turns out, as many women have discovered, that leaning in can actually get you sacked. Just hours after NYTimes.com unceremoniously removed Abramson's name from the masthead and Times publisher Arthur Sulzberger Jr. told employees she had been replaced, without offering much of an explanation, we learned that Abramson, who had held the job for less than three years, had confronted her bosses about her compensation, telling them she had discovered her total compensation -- salary and benefits -- was substantially lower than that of her predecessor, former editor Bill Keller. The Times quickly shot back, rejecting the pay disparity argument, saying Abramson's total compensation was comparable to Keller's, and that her ""pension benefit, like all Times employees, is based on her years of service and compensation. The pension benefit was frozen in 2009."" Sulzberger issued a statement later saying it wasn't about money and it's not true that Abramson was paid less than her predecessor. He said that in her last year, her total compensation package was more than 10% higher than Keller's in his last year as executive editor. Now it's become she said / he said. But compensation aside, in his announcement on Wednesday, Sulzberger did say his decision had to do with ""an issue with management in the newsroom."" So it's about management. OK. That seems to match a remarkably similar chain of events in Paris, where Natalie NougayrÃ¨de, the editor-in-chief of the prestigious newspaper, Le Monde, was forced out of her job after other journalists accused her of being too authoritarian, or ""Putin-like."" What a curious coincidence. Before Abramson's departure, the personality-driven criticism had wafted out of the Times newsroom, with accusations that reeked of sexism. A few months ago, an article discussed whether she is ""bitchy,"" and the word ""pushy"" keeps coming up. I have spent many years in the news business and I can think of countless successful high-level managers who were pushy, bossy, at times downright cruel with staff. Those men were often viewed as strong, driven, effective, determined, good leaders. The Washington Post's legendary Ben Bradlee was affectionately described as having a ""pugnacious personality."" And Abramson's predecessor, Bill Keller, said his wife describes him as ""socially autistic."" These traits would likely doom a woman's career. In men, they are viewed as quirks, curiosities, even assets in the single-minded pursuit of journalistic success. Men's personalities are fodder for office gossip, but more generally viewed as a secondary matter, perhaps a topic for conversation at the bar after a long day. With women, it infuses their professional persona. People expect women to be nice, likeable or feminine. And it turns out being strong and demanding, and not always warm and friendly, can destroy your career, or at least make for a much less successful one. You cannot win without losing. In order to do a good job, women may find they have to take actions that turn people against them. The problem with the stereotyping that demands women be liked and likeable is that it is much hazier, more difficult to counteract. It often lies hidden below the surface, alongside conscious efforts at equality. The New York Times and Le Monde and other major organizations have made strides to promote women. Abramson was the paper's first female executive editor. Her superior made a landmark decision in promoting her, just as they did with her replacement Dean Baquet, the Times' first African-American executive editor. But the tide of antagonism, the no-win rules that say you fail if you succeed can be found at all levels of the organization, including among rank-and-file staff. By objective standards, Abramson did a fine job. The paper won eight Pulitzer prizes during her brief tenure, with top-notch reporting and investigative journalism. Signups for digital access among readers increased. The company stock doubled during her tenure, performing better than the rest of the stock market. Doing a good job by objective measures, as we know, is not enough. That's especially true for women, who as Sheryl Sandberg pointed out in her book ""Lean In,"" worry about being liked. If it is difficult for women to exercise leadership in order to advance the businesses they lead, that obstacle is a mere bump on the road when compared to the challenge of advocating on their own behalf. We don't know to what extent Abramson's complaint about her compensation was a factor in her firing. But we know just how risky and complicated it is for women to ask for better pay. Women at every level are paid less than their male counterparts. Top female executives make 18% less than their male counterparts. The same is true for female journalists. Trying to change that is excruciatingly difficult. As a recent New York Times article puts it, asking for a promotion or raise can make women seem ""overly demanding and unlikeable"" and not ""sufficiently feminine, unseemly, if on a subconscious level."" It's all incredibly irritating and offensive. And it needs to change. The specific circumstance that brought Jill Abramson's sudden and shockingly undignified fall at the New York Times or Natalie NougayrÃ¨de's exit are almost secondary. The episodes have an ugly ring that is familiar to women. For all the progress we have seen, there is still a long, long way to go.","Jill Abramson, top editor at The New York Times, was fired by the paper's publisher .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 07:30 EST, 16 April 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 09:46 EST, 16 April 2012 . An Austrian millionaire who claimed he had given everything he owned to the poor because it never made him happy, has been exposed as a conman who simply wanted to get publicity to sell his house and cover his debts. Media around the world rushed to cover the story of Karl Rabeder when he revealed how he had liquidated everything and had invested the money in a bank to provide micro-financing to people in developing countries. He said he realised money did not make him happy and added: 'I was dying through consumerism. My cars and my plane have already gone – the rest will follow soon.' Conman: Austrian Millionaire Karl Rabeder claimed to have given his entire fortune to the poor but an investigation by a leading German magazine claims it is a scam . He had moved into a small alpine hut and planned to live on just a few hundred pounds a month. A Google search on his name comes up with 500,000 hits. But now a special investigation by respected German magazine Stern has revealed how the 49-year-old had actually hired three top public relations agencies to get his message of philanthropy around the world. Rabeder has since travelled the world for two years preaching his message of philanthropy as a guest on talkshows and other media - even writing a book with the title 'Only People with Nothing Have Everything to Give'. The magazine claimed that his promises have not been kept and in reality the whole scheme was a PR stunt designed to allow the financially struggling businessmen to sell off his Austrian property via a lottery so he could pay his debts. The public relations material sent out in March 2009 from the PR firms had the headline 'Win a Dream Villa and at the Same Time Do Something Good.' Property experts say the luxury Tyrol villa was probably not worth over 500,000, but by selling tickets and the massive exposure the plan attracted he had managed to sell 21,999 tickets for €99 each raising 1.78 million pounds. The winner – a woman from Bavaria – was announced in August 2010 and handed the keys. The magazine said that the money certainly gone to good use – but not for good causes. It said that in fact the only confirmed payment to a good cause had been a payment of  €14,886.20  that have been paid to the Austrian charity Light in Darkness and S.O.S. Kinderdorf – representing just 0.7 percent of the total raised. The PR companies that organised the . stunt as well as lawyers pocketed €643,000 while another €745,000 went . to pay off the mortgage. The . property also has a debt tied into the deeds of another €890,000 . from the part share he still had in his firm. This was also cleared. The . magazine said Rabeder had earlier run up massive debts 'living a . champagne lifestyle' on the money that he got from the partial share in . 2004 of his company selling living room accessories. At . the time he was 42 years old and had regarded himself as officially in . early retirement, and had purchased a second house in the South of . France - and speculated on the stock exchange. Scam: The raffle to sell the stunning home raised £1.78 million but the . investigation by Stern magazine found only €14,886.20,  0.7 . per cent, was paid to the Austrian charity Light in Darkness and S.O.S. Kinderdorf . But with the crash in 2007 Rabeder lost vast amounts of money and tried at that time without success to sell his villa in Tyrol. Desperate for money – he had been forced to sell his villa in the South of France at a substantial loss. By September 2010 after the successful sale of the Tyrol villa on the backs of massive publicity he had been able to avoid the insolvency of the remainder of his firm that he had not sold by coming to an arrangement with creditor banks to personally take over €510,000 of debt. Contacted by Stern and asked if money from the sale of the house had been used for creditors he said no. Asked where the money then come from he said: 'I had a few savings elsewhere.' When pushed he failed to provide any documents. Today he makes his money from seminars and talkshows, cashing in on his fame as a philanthropist. Media travelled to interview him, photograph and film him at the wooden hut he supposedly lives in on an alpine meadow – but when Stern visited the property they found no sign of him. They said that the hut was not usable . in the winter and had clearly not been lived in over winter. They also . found evidence that the property had occasionally been rented out in the . summer when he was supposed to have been living there as well. Also . under Austrian law – all residents in the country have to register . their address. But he is not registered anywhere in the country – and in . fact his last recorded contact address was a post box at the Vienna . Millennium Tower, a 202 metre high tower block in the centre of the . Austrian capital. Asked how . true his statement had been of investing everything he owned in . micro-credits in Third World countries he refused to put an amount down . on the table. He said: 'I don't want to state a sum. I will simply refer . you to my original statement that I have given everything that I have.' But . Stern pointed out that this could be nothing. His association . MyMicroCredit (MMC) still exists, but no proof that any money has gone . there. His online Internet . platform has been in existence for two years (www.mymicrocredit.org) and . has been gathering investment from private 'social investors' offering . interest-free miniature loans. Stern . said that many private investors and also invested large sums of money . with no strings attached including the publishing house that had printed . his book. The magazine adds . however that accounts which even an amateur football club has to . prepare in Austria have never been filed for the company. Austrian tax . expert Professor Erich Pummer from the University of Innsbruck said that . failing to file accounts was not an offence. When . questioned by the magazine he said he had never added it all together . because he had too little time. But he admitted there were thousands of . social investors that had probably invested a few hundred thousand Euro. Discrepancies: Although the house wasn't valued at more than €500,000, . the PR companies and lawyers that organised the raffle pocketed €643,000 . while another €745,000 went to pay off Rabeder's mortgage . But the magazine said that the information it had showed very little of the money from the social investors had gone to the preferred end Third World countries where it had been promised. MMC Partner in El Salvdaor, the microcredit company 'Apoyo Integral' said that they hadn't seen any money from him for a long time. They said that they had forwarded on 541 applications for loans from people in El Salvador and that of these 423 had appeared on the MMC page as being approved. But in reality only 278 applications totalling $98,106 had actually been transferred up until June 2010. After that Rabeder stopped making payments even though he continued to collect money at least until the end of last year for the social projects he was claiming to promote. The company said it had tried in vain up until April last year to get at least the remaining $46,000 that had been promised but with out any result. He simply had not paid, claiming to have had problems with German civil servants. He said he needed to change the legal form the company had in order to get round the legal issues that had been raised but when questioned German officials rejected that there had been any difficulties. Apoyo said that the payment difficulties have meant that they had cancelled their working relationship with Rabeder in July last year. A member of the board of Apoyo told Stern: 'We had grave doubts about the way he was operating financial organisation.'","'Struggling businessman' Karl Rabeder, 49, said he invested £3m to help people in developing countries .

"Los Angeles, California (CNN) -- A sister of a 17-year-old girl whose body was found this week two miles from her home in southern California said Friday she would not rest until the killer is apprehended. ""I will not have peace until this this person is found,"" Elizabeth Lopez, 18, said about the killer of her younger sister Norma, who vanished last Thursday as she walked home from summer classes at Valley View High School in Moreno Valley, about 70 miles east of Los Angeles. Authorities believe that Norma, who had planned to meet a younger sister and a friend at home, took a short cut through a dirt field to reach the family's residence. Her sister contacted the police when Lopez failed to return home. The girl's body was discovered Tuesday two miles away and identified Wednesday through dental records, police said. ""I always thought it was something safe,"" Lopez said about the path her sister typically followed. ""I never suspected that my sister would get kidnapped in this empty lot of just dirt."" Sgt. Joe Barja of the Riverside Valley Sheriff's Department declined to reveal the cause of death or reveal any injuries Lopez may have sustained but said the department is treating the death as a homicide. The victim's sister said the family was trying to stay strong and to find the killer. ""That's what's keeping us motivated -- to get that person in custody so no other family could actually go through what we are going through,"" Elizabeth Lopez told HLN's ""Prime."" ""There's a family here that loved her very much, even though sometimes we did fight -- but it was something stupid, something dumb. But we love her and miss her and one day we will be together again."" She expressed gratitude for the outpouring of support the family has received from the community, including a memorial service at the high school, which hundreds of students attended. ""I get a lot of strength from this,"" she said. ""I did not expect this many people to actually support us. I thought this was just going to be one of those kidnappings that people don't really get involved with ... I did not really expect anyone to actually really listen to the story that we had."" Lopez said her sister had hope to become a fashion designer, a makeup artist or a model. ""She had really big dreams in life,"" she said. She recalled the last time she saw her sister, the morning of her disappearance. ""She brought me a peanut butter and jelly sandwich and I opened up my sandwich and it had a happy face made with banana in it,"" Lopez said. The offering was intended to to persuade her sister to lend her a pair of shoes, she said. Police are looking for a green ""SUV-type vehicle"" that was seen driving from the area at the time of Lopez's disappearance. The parents, who are originally from Guanajuato, Mexico, were being assisted by the Mexican Consulate, said Carolina Zaragoza, head of the consulate's local office. The victim's father, Martin Lopez, 44, told CNN in a telephone interview that the neighborhood was generally a safe one and that Norma usually took precautions to stay safe.

"(CNN) -- An Arizona man lay handcuffed and non-responsive on the floor of a Walmart on Black Friday, as his emotional grandson stood nearby. Jerald Newman, 54, spent Friday night in a Maricopa County jail hours after being arrested for allegedly resisting arrest and shoplifting, according to the county sheriff's department. But the suspect's family members, as well as at least one witness, said the man is innocent and that the treatment was unnecessary. Newman's daughter said that she, her father and other family members were in the packed Buckeye, Arizona, store soon after it opened late Thursday night. ""They were just letting people in; there was nowhere to walk,"" Berneta Sanchez told CNN. ""And teenagers and adults were fighting for these games, taking them away from little kids and away from my father."" The grandson, Nicholas Nava, told CNN affiliate KNXV that Newman had grabbed one video game and put it under his shirt so that others jostling for the game didn't take it from him. One person alerted a police officer, who then approached Newman. David Chadd, a CNN iReporter from Las Vegas, was among those shopping for video games set up in the Walmart's grocery section in a mass of people. He said Newman ""was not resisting"" arrest as he was led away from the crowd by a police officer. The officer, Chadd said, then suddenly hooked the suspect around the leg, grabbed him and ""slammed him face first into the ground."" ""It was like a bowling ball hitting the ground, that's how bad it was,"" he said. That was around when Sanchez said she heard of the altercation from across the store and ran toward her father. ""I was fuming,"" she recalled upon seeing her father on the floor. ""They wouldn't let me near him at all, they were telling me to stay back."" Video, recorded by Chadd and later posted on CNN's iReport, shows an apparently unconscious Newman head-down on the floor in a pool of blood. As he's turned over, Buckeye police officers appear to attempt to revive him -- at which point his face, covered mostly in blood, is revealed. Several voices, apparently those of fellow shoppers, are heard saying, ""Why would you throw him down so hard? All he did was shoplifting and you threw him down like that?"" Another person says, ""They threw him down. He wasn't doing anything wrong."" Two citizens then appear to come to Newman's aid by applying paper towels to the man's nose. Chadd estimated that Newman was knocked out for about 10 minutes, all the while gushing blood and handcuffed. Walmart spokeswoman Ashley Hardie said the retail giant was aware of the incident. ""We are concerned whenever there is an incident involving a customer at one of our stores,"" Hardie said. ""We are in contact with the local police and are sharing any information we have with them."" Members of the Buckeye Police Department did not immediately respond to CNN calls Friday for comment. Assistant Chief Larry Hall told KNXV that Newman struggled after getting hurt, saying he was aggressive and escalated the situation. ""There's a whole other side to this story that wasn't videotaped,"" Hall said. ""There is nothing, on the surface, (that) deems our officer acted inappropriate at this time."" The Buckeye incident was one of a few such incidents involving police and shoppers at the chain's stores nationwide. Sanchez said that Newman was ""emotional"" when she talked to him, briefly, on Friday from a hospital where he was treated before being sent to jail. ""He was complaining of his pain, and he was angry,"" she said. She described her father as ""a really nice man,"" noting he is a custom furniture-maker who preaches through the California prison system. He has raised his grandson from birth and, even while in the hospital, Sanchez said the boy was her father's chief concern. Family members are hoping for a call from law enforcement, informing them that they can pick up Newman, Sanchez said. Until then, she said her mother plans to talk to a lawyer Saturday to work on expediting the man's release. Whatever happens, Sanchez vowed that next year she won't be shopping in the wee hours of the Friday morning after Thanksgiving. ""I will never leave my house again on Black Friday, because I don't want to put my daughter through that again,"" she said, noting her daughter was there to see police standing over her bloody grandfather. ""I'd rather stay home. And if they have Black Friday, they need more security.""

Hats off to the NHS.’ Mr King is keeping in good spirits and while his weight is creeping up due to the incident – undoing his work to lose 3.5 stone on his Hairy Dieters series – he is exercising to keep help with his rehabilitation, cycling, gardening and walking at least two miles a day. In the deeply personal interview, he said his recovery is going well: ‘There have been no lasting effects – none that you’d notice other than I am slightly madder than I was before. No deficit, as they say’. Mr King, who is married with three children, said he was not quite ready to resume TV work with Myers, 56, who was a Strictly Come Dancing contestant last year. ‘I’m not back at work yet. I want to keep myself right,’ he said. ‘The last thing I want to do is fall over on a shoot. I want to make sure I am 100 per cent fit. And I’m getting there. ‘Dave just wants me to get better so we can get back on the road.’ Mr King, along with Dave Myers, have been making programmes under the banner of the Hairy Bikers since 2004, bridging the gap between a cookery show and a travelogue . Mr King told the Daily Mirror the only silver lining in the horrible ordeal is being able to spend more time with his wife Jane and three sons Alex, James and Dylan. And, as his TV commitment often keep him away from home for long periods of time, his wife is also enjoying having him around more too. He said: ‘She’s not fed up. I think she secretly quite likes it. We haven’t done it for such a long time. We go, “Oh, this is quite nice”. ‘I have been home for James, my middle son’s, birthday for the first time in four or five years.

He said: ‘It was great and we have never looked back. We have a loyal fanbase which we are very privi-leged and proud to have. ‘[Dave’s] great – we are like two brothers.

Pellegrini said the fans can expect to see more of Jovetic this season after he made only 11 league appearances last term. 'Well Stevan had a very bad luck last year, he had a lot of injuries the whole year, so it's very difficult for a player to have an important performance when he cannot play three games in a row,' he said.

"By . Ap . PUBLISHED: . 18:06 EST, 26 May 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 18:16 EST, 26 May 2013 . It seems that the impossible has occurred: The nation's most congested city has become a model for traffic control. Yes, . gridlock still prevails and drivers' blood pressure still spikes as . LA's traffic arteries seize up during every morning and afternoon rush . hour. Yet, with the flip of a switch earlier . this year, Los Angeles became a worldwide leader by synchronizing all of . its nearly 4,400 stoplights, making it the world's first major city to . do so. Synched up: all of Los Angeles' 4,400 stop lights are now synched up . The result? Well, it can still be hell . to cross the City of the Angels by car. Synchronization has allowed LA . to boast of real improvements on paper, however, the average driver . won't always be able to discern the difference of a project that took . nearly 30 years to complete. ""To be honest . with you, I haven't felt it, yet,"" said Jack Abramyam, who has been . driving a cab across LA's mean streets for 20 years. ""Late . at night, maybe, yes,"" Abramyam said as he sat outside his cab on a . street in Chinatown recently, waiting for a fare. ""But it was never . really bad then anyway. During the day it was bad. And it's still bad."" The . way synchronization works is simple enough: With all the signals . synchronized, if you drive down a street at the posted speed limit you . should be able to make every green light - from one end of this . sprawling city of 469 square miles to the other. Of course there are any number of obstacles that can prevent that. Congestion: transportation engineer associate Abeer Kliefe works at the Los Angeles Department of Transportation's Automated Traffic Surveillance and Control Center . On . a recent mid-afternoon test drive down eight miles of Wilshire . Boulevard, for example, I was cut off by a bus, stuck behind more than . one right-turner waiting for pedestrians to cross the intersecting . street and at one point had my lane blocked by a delivery truck. Approaching . the world famous La Brea Tar Pits - where prehistoric dinosaurs once . got stuck in muck, not traffic - so many people were waiting to turn . left into a parking lot that the street became gridlocked for more than . two blocks. The numerous synchronized green lights didn't wait for me. But why would they? With the posted speed limit 35 mph, I was only . averaging 15. Still, once the LA County Museum . of Art, the high-rise apartments, the headquarters of porn publisher . Larry Flynt and the various other Wilshire Boulevard landmarks were in . the rear-view mirror, the pace did pick up. So much so that 11 green . lights in a row suddenly materialized. That string ended on the edge of . downtown, however, when Wilshire simply became clogged with too many . cars. It was a non-rush hour jam that demonstrated that, good as . synchronization may be, it isn't a magic, traffic-breaking bullet. Los Angeles Department of Transportation officials agree. City of angels - and gridlock: Los Angeles freeways are amongst the most congested in the world . As . they stated in a recent report praising the benefits of synchronized . signals, ""No traffic signal system is capable of `fixing traffic.'"" If . more motor vehicles show up in the years ahead (and there are already . more than 7.1 million of them registered in Los Angeles County, a number . greater than that of most states), then officials say LA traffic jams . will probably get worse. That's why, said . Clinton Quan, an engineering associate with the Department of . Transportation, planners are continuing to push people to ride bicycles, . take commuter rail lines and other public transportation and move close . enough to work that they can walk there. The . city has added three light rail lines in the last seven years and has . more planned. Officials also recently approved plans to allow high-rise . apartment and condominium buildings along a corridor in Hollywood where a . subway connecting the city's West Side to downtown is supposed to go. In . the meantime, Quan says, the synchronized signal program is putting up . some pretty impressive numbers, even if the average driver isn't . noticing them. It has reduced the drive time on several major LA . corridors, for example, by about 12 percent. In driver-speak, that means the trip across town that used to take you an hour has been reduced to about 53 minutes. And . that's nothing to shrug at, says Robert Puentes, a senior fellow with . the Brookings Institution's metropolitan policy program, which studies . among other things the impact of traffic on the quality of life in . metropolitan areas. Several other . traffic-clogged cities are looking into instituting similar programs and . New York already synchronizes some of its stoplights, said Puentes, who . works in Washington, D.C., the ninth-worst traffic-clogged city in the . country. ""If you can get a 12 percent reduction on, say, the Washington Beltway, that would be phenomenal,"" he said.","Los Angeles became a worldwide leader by synchronizing all of . its nearly 4,400 stoplights, making it the world's first major city to . do so.

"Vladimir Putin has offered to have a replica Super Bowl ring made for Robert Kraft after the Russian President was accused of stealing it. In his first official statement about the ring allegations, the Russian leader told Petersburg Economic Forum he did not remember Mr Kraft or the ring, but seeing as it was so valuable he would have more made for the New England Patriots' owner. 'I remember that I was handed some souvenirs. If this is such a great value for Kraft and the respective team, I have a proposal,' President Putin said. Scroll down for video . New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft has claimed that Vladimir Putin took his Super Bowl ring and that the White House told him to say it was a gift . He suggested that a Russian factory . could create a replica, using 'good metal and stone' so a copy of the . ring can be given to Mr Kraft and the team. '[It] will be the smartest … solution to this complex, international problem,' he added. The ring is believed to be in the . library of the Kremlin, which has denied Mr Kraft's account the . President Putin walked off with the ring during a meeting in St . Petersburg in 2005,according to the New York Post. Since details of the ring's disappearance first emerged, Mr Kraft backtracked on his original claim that President Putin . stole the Super Bowl Ring. A spokesman for the billionaire businessman said Mr Kraft's claim that Putin pocketed his $25,000 Super Bowl XXXIX ring was a 'humorous, anecdotal story that Robert retells for laughs.' A . careful reading of the statement, though, reveals that Mr  Kraft isn't . saying the story is untrue - only that it isn't meant to be taken . seriously. Mr Kraft had said that after Putin . made off with his ring, he was pressured by the Bush White House into . calling it a gift was a gift and letting Putin keep it. On Sunday, Kraft's spokesman said: . '(Kraft) loves that his ring is at the Kremlin, and, as he stated back . in 2005, he continues to have great respect for Russia and the . leadership of President Putin.' It's a good thing, too. Because Putin isn't giving it back. Putin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told CNN  the ring resides at the Kremlin museum - where all 'state gifts' are kept. He denied that Putin stole the ring - . insisting that Mr Kraft freely gave it to the Russian leader in 2005 at a . meeting in Saint Petersburg. 'What Mr. Kraft is saying now is . weird. I was standing 20 centimeters away from him and Mr. Putin and saw . and heard how Mr. Kraft gave this ring as a gift,' he told the network.

'It's a humorous, anecdotal story that Robert retells for laughs. 'He loves that his ring is at the Kremlin, and, as he stated back in 2005, he continues to have great respect for Russia and the leadership of President Putin. 'In particular, he credits President Putin for modernizing the Russian economy.' The statement adds that the ring being at the Kremlin has 'an added benefit from the attention this story gathered eight years ago was the creation of some Patriots fan clubs in Russia.' ‘I took out the ring and showed it to . [Putin], and he put it on and he goes, “I can kill someone with this . ring,”’  Mr Kraft told the crowd. Mr Kraft continued: ‘I put my hand out and he put it in his pocket, and three KGB guys got around him and walked out.’ The incident occurred in 2005, the summer after the Patriots had won their third Super Bowl under his  ownership. He was one of a number of prominent American businessmen who visited Russia to meet with Putin. At the time, Mr  Kraft released a public statement saying the . diamond-encrusted ring - worth more than  $25,000 - had been a gift. 'President Putin, a great and knowledgeable sports fan, was clearly taken . with its uniqueness. I decided to give him the ring as a symbol of the . respect and admiration that I have for the Russian people and [his] . leadership,' read Kraft's statement at the time. But now Mr .

"(CNN) -- Wael Ghonim, a Google executive who has been missing for more than a week following his purported arrest in Cairo, is to be released Monday, according to two Egyptian television news networks. Telecom executive Naguib Sawiris announced on OTV Sunday that Ghonim would be released at 4 p.m. Monday. Sawiris told CNN that Egyptian Vice President Omar Suleiman assured him during a Sunday meeting between government officials and opposition leaders that Ghonim would be released. State-run Nile TV reported that Prime Minister Ahmad Shafiq called the network to announce that a Google executive missing for more than a week will be released Monday. There was no explanation as to the executive's whereabouts or condition. Sawiris is a member of the so-called Committee of the Wise, a group of independent elite leaders of Egyptian society taking part in talks over the future of the country. The announcements follow the release of a statement earlier Sunday by the human rights group Amnesty International. The statement warned that Ghonim was at risk of being tortured by Egytian authorities. ""The Egyptian authorities must immediately disclose where Wael Ghuneim is and release him or charge him with a recognizable criminal offence,"" said Hassiba Hadj Sahraoui, deputy director of Middle and North Africa at Amnesty International. ""He must be given access to a doctor and a lawyer of his choice and not be subjected to torture or other ill-treatment. His case is just one of many that highlight the continued crackdown by the Egyptian authorities on those exercising their right to protest peacefully."" Ghonim, according to Amnesty International, was declared missing after he failed to meet with his brother January 28, as planned, to take part in street demonstrations. Ghonim, who heads Google's marketing operations in north Africa and the Middle East, had been in Cairo on a business trip since January 23. Ghonim is from Dubai, according to the human rights group. Family members became concerned when they discovered that Ghonim's telephones had been disconnected, according to the human rights group. Eyewitnesses later told family members they had seen Egyptian authorities arrest Ghonim during demonstrations near Mustafa Mohamed Street.","Egyptian authorities to let Google executive go, executive says .

"Bangkok, Thailand (CNN) -- High tide on Friday sent some water pouring into the Bangkok's Chinatown area, but it receded within a few hours, while the commercial district remained largely dry. Those who have stayed in the city despite the government's pleas to leave are waiting to see if the highest tide, forecast to come Saturday afternoon, will overwhelm defenses along the city's river and many canals and bring more damaging floods. Floodwaters that drenched much of central and lower parts of northern Thailand crept Thursday into Bangkok, stressing embankments and flooding roads, parking lots, factories and markets and sending many residents fleeing for dry ground. Up to 1 meter (3.2 feet) of water was expected in some areas, said Thai Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra, as the Chao Phraya River spilled into the city of 12 million people. Several districts were under a mandatory evacuation order. ""There is water from underground coming up,"" said Pracha Promnok, chief of the Flood Relief Operations Center. ""We are unable to do anything (to stop it)."" Yingluck fielded criticism that the flood relief center had not done enough and -- with tears in her eyes -- called on the public to sympathize with emergency staff, as some of them had also become victims of the flooding. ""Many are exhausted and some problems cannot be controlled and were not caused by (the center),"" Yingluck said, according to MCOT. Thailand's government declared public holidays through the rest of the month in 21 flood-affected provinces, and appealed to Bangkok residents to head to the countryside. People flocked to bus terminals and crowded the Suvarnabhumi Airport, the main airport, in hopes of reaching higher ground. The smaller domestic airport, its runways inundated, was closed until November 1, but Suvarnabhumi was operating normally, protected by 3.5 meters (almost 12 feet) of dikes, said Toopetch Booyarith of the Airport Authority of Thailand. ""We are confident that we will not be affected,"" Toopetch said. CNNGo: Updated info for tourists . The streets of the normally bustling metropolis that is notorious for massive traffic jams stood empty Thursday, save for a few public buses and taxis that were able to navigate through. There was even water standing before the Grand Palace, perhaps the most adored of Bangkok's landmarks. In some neighborhoods vacated by people, domestic animals were left to fend for themselves. ""You'll see dogs stranded on rooftops, dogs trying to swim,"" said Marcelo Cacciola, of the Soi Dog Foundation. ""So we went to these little towns around the Bangkok area with boats and rescued the dogs."" Some hotels slashed prices to accommodate the flood-affected and some tourist areas reported full occupancies. In the resort town of Pattaya, fleeing Bangkok residents found it hard to get a room in hotels overflowing with European tourists, the Bangkok Post reported. Thanyarat Hemkittiwat said she was planning to leave Bangkok to stay with relatives outside the city. ""Some families in southern Bangkok had their house flooded,"" said the 31-year-old worker at a furniture export company, which was shut after it, too, was flooded. ""The water level is two meters (six feet) high and smells very bad,"" she said. She said the military had set up a flood relief center, ""but now even that has water coming in it."" UNICEF said it was providing $300,000 in aid that includes 20,000 insecticide-treated mosquito nets. The U.S. State Department issued a travel alert recommending against all but essential travel to affected areas. It noted that most tourist destinations, such as Phuket and Chiang Mai, were unaffected. U.S. Ambassador Kristie Kenny said the crisis was slow-moving and it was hard to know what would be hit next. The United States has already provided civilian relief resources, including water pumps, water purifiers and life vests, she said, and two U.S. helicopters are helping the Thai military determine the extent of the flooding. The floods, caused by monsoon rains that saturated rivers, have killed 373 people nationwide and affected more than 9.5 million people, authorities said. Are you there? Share photos, video but stay safe . The government has called the flooding the worst to afflict the nation in half a century and said it might take more than a month before the waters recede from some areas. The government has set up more than 1,700 shelters nationwide, and more than 113,000 people have taken refuge in them. Overall damage from the floods could exceed $6 billion, the Thai Finance Ministry said. CNN's Sara Sidner, Aliza Kassim and Elizabeth Yuan contributed to this report.

"Ed Miliband, pictured here with his wife Justine, has been challenged by MPs to prove that he did not try to avoid tax in relation to his property dealings . Ed Miliband faced calls last night to publish full details of his tax affairs. The Labour leader’s family affairs have come under the spotlight after he spent much of last week condemning ‘tax dodgers’. The Daily Mail told yesterday how he and his family used a ‘deed of variation’ to divide ownership of their family home – which experts say is used almost exclusively to reduce death duty bills. It has now emerged that Mr Miliband and his partner Justine Thornton – his wife since 2011 – both sold separate flats they owned in upmarket North London in 2008 and 2009 without paying capital gains tax. Mr Miliband sold his £740,000 apartment five months after the purchase of their family home for £1.6million and six months after the couple had their first son. But he claimed that the flat was his ‘primary residence’. Saying the flats were their primary homes enabled them both to save tens of thousands of pounds in capital gains tax. Labour yesterday insisted any suggestion of tax avoidance is a ‘straightforward lie’. And today Mr Miliband is expected to say he is ‘not backing down’ in his campaign against tax avoidance, despite the controversy about his own affairs. In a speech to the Welsh Labour conference he will accuse ministers of ‘turning a blind eye’ to tax avoidance. But the Conservatives last night stepped up pressure on him to publish the details of his tax affairs. Mr Miliband managed to avoid paying capital gains tax on the sale of the flat he owned before moving into the townhouse where his family now live. Mr Miliband met Miss Thornton in 2002. In the following years, they owned separate flats. He originally had an apartment on Chalcot Square but sold this for £342,000 in 2005, before buying a flat on nearby Chalcot Road about a year later for £648,500. It is not known where Mr Miliband, then 36, lived in the intervening months. But Miss Thornton owned a flat in Maida Vale. This was sold for £680,000 in March 2008, with Miss Thornton paying no capital gains tax. A Labour spokesman has said this is because it was her primary residence. Yet when Mr Miliband sold his flat on Chalcot Road for £740,000 in December 2009, he did not pay capital gains tax either, as he claimed this was his primary residence. This is despite the fact that five months earlier Miss Thornton – an environmental law expert on around £200,000 a year – had bought for £1.6 million the family home near Hampstead Heath where they now live. She had also given birth to their first son Daniel earlier that year, in June 2009. They were able to avoid the tax in part because they were unmarried. Mr Miliband and Miss Thornton became engaged in 2010 and married a year later. Miss Thornton, however, is still registered as the sole owner of their four-bedroom Victorian property for reasons that are unclear. Tory MP Andrew Bridgen said Mr Miliband’s family’s deed of variation was clearly designed to cut inheritance tax and condemned the Labour leader’s denial of this. He added: ‘Ed Miliband should now publish this deed of variation that he is currently hiding away and be as open about his own tax affairs as he demands others to be. The public can then judge for themselves.’ The former Director of Public Prosecutions Sir Keir Starmer, now a Labour parliamentary candidate, added: ‘People will take different views on deeds of variation and all forms of tax relief is, in one sense, intended to reduce tax. People have a strong feeling that sophisticated tax avoidance is morally wrong.’ MPs want to know if Mr Miliband and his family used tax avoidance strategies when trading houses . Mr Miliband has spent the week lambasting tax dodgers in the wake of allegations that HSBC’s Swiss private bank helped clients evade tax. He had gone on the attack over allegations of tax avoidance activities linked to some wealthy supporters of the Conservative Party, telling the House of Commons that David Cameron was ‘a dodgy Prime Minister surrounded by dodgy donors’. Mr Miliband was subsequently forced to defend his own tax affairs. Asked by BBC political editor Nick Robinson if he thought it was ‘dodgy’ to use a deed of variation and leave your house to your children to avoid tax, the Labour leader said: ‘The deed of variation... is something my mother did 20 years ago. I paid tax as a result of that transaction, I’ve avoided no tax in that.’ Mr Miliband’s father’s will was changed by deed of variation after his death in 1994 so Ed, David and their mother Marion all became part-owners of their £2.4million family home. This meant that if she then died, the sons would already own part of the property so inheritance tax would be applicable to less of the home than were she to have owned it outright. Mr Miliband has, however, since sold his share to his brother, who bought the remainder from his mother, who is still alive. He also claims to have paid capital gains tax at 40 per cent on the sale and denied he used the arrangement to avoid tax. A spokesman said: ‘It can’t be tax avoidance if no tax was avoided.’ Last night a spokesman for Mr Miliband insisted the couple only moved in together in 2008 – six years into their relationship and when Mr Miliband was 38 and Miss Thornton 37. ‘As HMRC guidance makes clear, primary residence relief continues for three years after you leave your home. The final 36 months of ownership always qualify for relief as long as the dwelling house has been your only or main residence at some point.’ BY JAMES CONEY, MONEY MAIL EDITOR . Why did the family change Ralph Miliband’s will? Changing someone’s will using a deed of variation is a relatively rare event and requires the agreement of all the beneficiaries – so why did the Miliband family do it? Was it because their father had forgotten something, or was it simply for tax planning reasons? If Mrs Miliband wanted to give some of the house to her sons she could have done that without changing her husband’s will – but this would have given her a tax liability when she continued living in the property. By altering the will and essentially making Ralph Miliband give a share of the house to his sons as a gift, Mrs Miliband was allowed to remain living there tax free. It also meant that when Ed and David came to inherit the house their tax liabilities would have been reduced. Figures produced for the Mail suggest this could have saved them £160,000 if they had inherited in 2004. George Bull, senior tax partner at accountancy firm Baker Tilly said: ‘A deed of variation is an established part of tax planning but it is not that common. Generally in the event of someone’s death the beneficiaries of the estate usually accept what is written in the will and shrug their shoulders and say that is that.’ What did Ed Miliband class as his main home from 1995 until 2004? In 1995 Ed Miliband owned 20 per cent of the family home in Edis Street, but also bought a second-floor flat in nearby Chalcot Square for around £100,000. Then in 2004 David bought the Edis Street property outright from Ed and their mother. You do not pay capital gains tax when you sell your main home, but you do have to pay tax on any gains you make above a certain level on a second home. In 2004, this was charged at a person’s highest income tax rate on gains of more than £8,200. Ed says he paid tax of 40 per cent on the sale of his stake of Edis Street to David. But exactly how much was the bill? Second-home owners have to notify HM Revenue & Customs which property is their main home. But they can switch this at any time. Every time they do this, the previous three years of house price gains are discounted (as the rules stand today, it is only 18 months). This allows second-home owners to reduce their tax liability when prices are rising fast. If Edis Street was not classed as his main home, it is estimated Ed’s captial gains tax bill could have been up to £56,000, depending on other gains he cashed in at that time. So which property was Ed living in from 1995, and which did he tell HMRC was his main home? Was it ever switched? Where did Ed and Justine live ? Ed Miliband first met Justine Thornton in 2002 and they married in 2011. For most of this time up until 2009 they each owned their own property. Last night a Labour Party spokesman insisted that they only moved in together in 2008. However, there are questions about where Ed lived between selling his home in 2005 and buying in Chalcot Road the following year. Up until 2008 Justine owned her own apartment in nearby Maida Vale. Had the couple been married and living together only one property would have been able to be classed as a primary residence – the other would have been a second home and as such any gains made on it would have incurred capital gains tax after a period.

"(CNN) -- The family of Kendrick Johnson has sued a south Georgia school district claiming it was negligent in protecting their son from harassment and bullying, which they contend led to his death. Johnson's body was found in a rolled-up mat in the Lowndes High School gymnasium on January 11, 2013. The lawsuit was filed in State Superior Court on Tuesday. It alleges that Lowndes County Board of Education was negligent and violated Johnson's constitutional right to equal protection based on race. Johnson was African-American. Investigators with the Sheriff's Office ruled his death accidental -- concluding that Johnson climbed into the center of the gym mat to reach for a shoe and got stuck. Kenneth and Jacquelyn Johnson believe that their son was beaten to death. They hired an independent pathologist, who found ""unexplained apparent nonaccidental blunt force trauma"" to the teen's neck and concluded the death was a homicide. The U.S. Attorney for the Middle District of Georgia launched a federal investigation into the case on October 31, 2013. An attorney for Lowndes County Schools had not returned CNN's request for comment by Tuesday evening.

"Smoking cannabis every day warps key structures of the brain, a scientific study suggests. Regular use of the drug seems to shrink the brain’s ‘grey matter’ - the cells that crunch information - according to head scans of heavy drug users. The wiring of the brain – the ‘white matter’ that connects different parts - grows to compensate for the loss of the vital cells, scientists found. But eventually that also breaks down, impairing a drug users’ ability to use and react to information. Scroll down for video . Regular cannabis use appears to shrink the brain's 'grey matter' -  the cells that crunch information - according to scientists at the universities of Texas and New Mexico . The brain scan study is one of the first to investigate the drug’s long-term neurological impact in living people. The findings add to a growing weight of evidence that suggests cannabis is more harmful than legalisation campaigners would have us believe. It comes after a review of 20 years of cannabis research, published last month by a professor at King’s College London, revealed that one in six teenagers who use cannabis become dependent on the drug, as do one in 10 adults. That review also suggested that cannabis use in teenagers doubles the risk of developing psychotic disorders including schizophrenia. The authors of the new study, from the universities of Texas and New Mexico, warn that people who take the drug in heavy quantities for prolonged periods are likely to suffer damaging effects. A definitive 20-year study into the effects of long-term cannabis use has demolished the argument that the drug is safe. Cannabis is highly addictive, causes mental health problems and opens the door to hard drugs, the study found. The paper by Professor Wayne Hall, a drugs advisor to the World Health Organisation, builds a compelling case against those who deny the devastation cannabis wreaks on the brain. Professor Hall found: . Examining brain scans, the scientists found that chronic marijuana users - who smoked an average of three times a day - had smaller average volumes of grey matter in the orbitofrontal cortex, the part of the brain involved in mental processing and decision making. The cannabis users were also seen to have more ‘white matter’ - the connections between cells which affect how the brain learns and functions. The researchers suspect that those extra connections are forged as the brain tries to compensate for the lack of crucial grey matter. But even those extra connections were seen to break up within six to eight years under prolonged cannabis abuse, they found. Dr Sina Aslan from the University of Texas said: ‘What’s unique about this work is that it combines three different magnetic resonance imaging techniques to evaluate different brain characteristics. ‘The results suggest increases in connectivity, both structural and functional that may be compensating for grey matter losses. ‘Eventually, however, the structural connectivity or “wiring” of the brain starts degrading with prolonged marijuana use.’ The team studied MRI scans of the brains of 48 adult cannabis users aged 20 to 36 who were compared with a group of 62 non-users. The orbitofrontal cortex region of the brain, where the biggest differences in cannabis users’ brains was seen, is strongly linked to empathy - the ability to sense other people’s feelings. Neuroscientists believe damage to the orbitofrontal cortex may underpin many cases of personality disorder and psychopathy. The researchers found that the effect differed markedly depending on the age they started smoking and the number of years they continued to abuse the drug. The earlier someone started smoking cannabis, the greater the structural change to the brain and the larger the growth in white matter connections. This may explain why some chronic cannabis users sometimes appear to be coping normally, effectively masking the damage to their brain, the scientists said. Examining brain scans, the scientists found that chronic marijuana users - who smoked an average of three times a day - had smaller average volumes of grey matter, pictured on an MRI scan in light blue and green, in the orbitofrontal cortex, the part of the brain involved in mental processing and decision making . But after six to eight years of continually taking cannabis the increases in structural wiring declined, they found. The scientists said that because their study represented a simple snapshot of users’ brains, and did not monitor them over time, they could not be certain that the damage was directly caused by the drug. While the statistical picture they built up suggests that the drug abuse is linked to the structure of the brain, to be absolutely sure they more research is needed, they said. Co-author Dr Francesca Filbey, also from Texas, said: ‘We have seen a steady increase in the incidence of marijuana use since 2007. ‘However, research on its long-term effects remains scarce - despite the changes in legislation surrounding marijuana and the continuing conversation surrounding this relevant public health topic. ‘While our study does not conclusively address whether any or all of the brain changes are a direct consequence of marijuana use, these effects do suggest that these changes are related to age of onset and duration of use.’ UK drugs law has been the subject of much debate in recent years. The Labour government downgraded the drug to Class C in 2004 – meaning officers did not normally arrest those caught with the drug - but reversed their decision within five years, returning it to Class B status. Celebrities including Russell Brand, Richard Branson and Sting have called for it to be decriminalised, as has Professor David Nutt, the government’s former drugs advisor.","Scientists at the universities of Texas and New Mexico found the drug does warp key structures in the brain .

"(CNN) -- Fashion lovers crowded into a limestone townhouse on the prestigious Upper East Side of New York City on Wednesday night for an exclusive designer showcase. The house didn't belong to posh members of the high fashion elite, but to the Consulate General of the Russian Federation. The Russian Fashion Industry Showcase and Reception is one of several nationally-driven shows at New York Fashion Week promoting textile and apparel production unique to the countries. Upcoming shows will highlight the best in material and design from Korea, Japan, France and Scandinavia, but Wednesday night was all about the Russians. The evening embodied the Imperial Russia zeitgeist; chandeliers dripped with crystal, women glided about draped in fur, well-tailored men straightened their pocket squares as they passed gilded mirrors. The crowd sipped vodka and ogled designs from a conglomerate of modern Russian designers, including Serguei Teplov, Dmitry Loginov, Tegin, Irina Shaposhnikova, Sergey Polyakov and Aleksandr Khrisanfov. American figure skater Johnny Weir, who has his eyes on a third Olympic Games, in the Russian city of Sochi, stopped in and posed for photos. Russia's storied history was on display: A model's hair was mussed into a babushka headpiece; another stood with the rigid posture of a ballerina in laser-cut leather; all of them wore black outfits reflective of the country's harsh climate and lack of sunshine. ""New York City itself and, by default, Fashion Week is an avowedly international forum where everyone is welcomed and, for the most part, accepted,"" said Stephan Rabimov, the founder and editor in chief of DEPESHA magazine, which co-sponsored the event. ""It's a new type of communication channel to promote national interests: fashion, culture, tourism."" Rabimov said the U.S. fashion consumer is the perfect client for any ambitious designer. High-style buyers are, on average, well-educated professionals with lots of disposable income. Not only is the U.S. consumer a draw to international outlets, but New York is a global fashion capital on par with Paris, Milan and London. ""The American market is, simply, among the biggest, and they're very creative. As much as we can celebrate the savoir-faire of the French, I think Americans are the most creative,"" said Elisabeth Leontieff-Hirshon, a senior manager of UBIFRANCE. The Academy of Art University in San Francisco is showing a collaborative collection sponsored by UBIFRANCE, the French Trade Commission, on Friday at Lincoln Center in an effort to boost the profile of French mills in the United States. The collaboration was launched after approximately 250 meters of fabric was donated by French mills to the university, according to Leontieff-Hirshon. Leontieff-Hirshon said the appeal of partnering French textiles with American students is that U.S. designers are typically more open to new fabrics and new ideas. ""The American market knows what's good and what's selling; they're visionaries,"" she said. An emerging market stepping onto the catwalk: Asia. Concept Korea is a collaborative show organized by the Ministry of Culture, among other state agencies. On display: true Gangnam style. During Concept Korea's show at Mercedes-Benz Fashion Week last September, Korean designer Kathleen Kye showcased for the first time. That appearance later helped launch her collection at Opening Ceremony, a boutique synonymous with fashion ambassadorship, featuring designs from a different country each year. ""It is a must that we create a presence in New York in order to step into global market,"" said Sang-Pyo Hong, chief director at Korea Creative Content Agency. Leather Japan is yet another Asia-driven show sponsored by the country's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry. Eight Japanese brands will showcase Japanese leather products, hoping to highlight the designers' craftsmanship, said Kaoru Imajo, a spokesman for the event. While the country's economy is flagging, new Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has recently advocated stimulating growth by increasing exports; a somewhat contentious strategy because it could correlate with a depreciation of Japan's currency. ""The Japanese yen is expensive now, so that is not good for exporting, but the brands are trying everything they can to make it better,"" said Imajo. Rounding out the globe, there's a Scandinavian showcase with designers SIPILÃ„, Viola Blu and Olav making their debut to the U.S. market. Also showing is EDUN, a label working to increase trade with Africa that was launched in 2005 by Ali Hewson and her husband, U2 frontman Bono. While it's common practice for government-run organizations to participate in international trade shows like COTERIE and PremiÃ¨re Vision, governments actively orchestrating Fashion Week events is a recent development. ""That's why everyone who actually wants to sell clothes flocks here vying for interest of the best buyers and best media,"" said Rabimov. ""It is a perfect mix to launch a new brand, revamp heavyweights or showcase any country's fashion industry potential.""

"Never taking the people you love for granted could be the key to a happy life according to pensioners wishing to dispense their wisdom to their grandchildren. Three sets of pensioners, including centenarians Maurice and Helen Kaye, have recording a video featuring their advice  for future generations. And the key to being happy it appears is worrying less, following your dreams, not worrying about the future and being thankful for what you have. Scroll down for video . Maurice and Helen Kaye have revealed their happiest moments are when they met and arranged a date . Betty Hal, 95 (left) said one of her happiest memories was going to see her husband in hospital during the war . The video asked the pensioners about their happiest moments and what advice they would give to their grandchildren to safeguard their future well-being. As well as not taking people for granted, Betty, 95, and Doug, 100, Hale, of Winchester, along with William, 84, Maureen, 80, Norman, of Wellingborough also advised people not to hold grudges and to live in the moment rather than worry. The couples listed meeting each other, getting married and having their own children as among their most treasured memories. 1. Never take the people you love for granted . 2. Believe in yourself . 3. Remember what is important to you . 4. Nothing worth having comes easy . 5. Put your heart and soul into everything you do . 6. Don't hold grudges . 7. Don't be jealous of success . 8. Stop worrying and live in the moment . 9. Spend more time with your family . 10. Choose your friends wisely . Mrs Kaye, 101, of Bournemouth, said her happiest moment was when her husband of 80 years walked into her parents' shop for the first time to pick up an order and didn't leave for three hours. She said: 'I think my best memory was when he walked into my mother's shop to get an order and after three hours my mother said who is going to throw him out, you or me, because no customers can get in.' Mr Kaye, 102, said that while that day was not his favourite, as he was chucked out, he was able to arrange a date with his future wife a few weeks later. As couples who lived through the Second World War, the pensioners said that appreciating each other has been central to their happiness. Mrs Hale said: 'One of my happiest memories is when I went up to Manchester to see Doug when he was brought back from the second front in France wounded. 'I walked into the hospital and there he was in hospital blues and he looked at me and there was a great big smile on his face.'

Birth of another child . 5. Day of retirement . 6. Moving into a new home . 7. Seeing your child's first steps . 8. Hearing your child's first words . 9. Meeting the man or woman of your dreams . 10. First kiss with them. And the biggest regrets.... 1. Choosing the wrong career . 2. Not furthering education . 3. Not travelling enough . 4. Getting divorced . 5. Getting married too soon . Mrs Norman said while having her children was one of her happiest memories, she feels most content now. She said: 'I'm more happy now than I've ever been. Our generation have been through World War Two when things were rationed and food was rationed. 'It makes us appreciate the things we have now. I could kiss my automatic washing machine.' The research also revealed that men are happiest at 40, while women hit their positive peak at 38 - citing being fit and healthy, having a great group of friends and feeling confident in their appearance as the main reasons. The findings show loving relationships outweigh money and material gains with life's top ten happiest moments dominated by friends and family. The most common cause for regret was choosing the wrong career and not pursuing lifelong dreams. One in ten of those with regrets wished they had worked harder in school with seven per cent regretting that they had not travelled the world.

"By . Rebecca Seales . PUBLISHED: . 06:12 EST, 8 April 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 06:46 EST, 8 April 2012 . Trapped: Mrs Shah - who has adopted a pseudonym for her own protection - was forced into marriage at just five years old, despite living in an ordinary British town (picture posed by model) A successful businesswoman has told of her agony after being forced into an abusive marriage at the age of five - despite living in Britain. Samina Shah, who is now in her 40s and too frightened to reveal her real name, spoke out after revelations that Britain's Forced Marriage Unit had handled the case of another five-year-old girl last year. Mrs Shah said she believed she was being dressed for her fifth birthday party on the day of the Islamic ceremony which effectively ended her childhood. She told The Sun: 'There was a lot of . activity - a lot of relatives in the house. I was dressed up in an . outfit which my mother-in-law had bought for me. 'My sister told me later that my mother-in-law had said, ""At last, the beautiful girl belongs to me!""' Pondering . why a tiny girl from a large northern town would be forced to undergo . such an ordeal, she said she thought it was to do with maintaining . tradition - and control. Mrs . Shah was born into a close-knit Asian community, and while her family . lived in Britain they remained true to the conventions of remote . Pakistani villages. Aged . just 13, she was removed from school without explanation. Instead of an . education, she was taught that a woman's place was in the home - and . reminded that the greater her sufferings on earth, the more lavish her . reward would be in Paradise. Samina . was still a frightened girl of 14 when she went through the formal . wedding ceremony which marked her transition from her parents' house to . that of her husband. At 6am the day after, she was forced onto a plane . to Pakistan, told only that she would return to Britain with her husband . when she reached 16. Long before that time, the teenager endured the forced consummation of her marriage after suffering an appalling beating. Missing - one childhood: Locked up by her husband, child bride Mrs Shah used to watch other children playing outside and sigh with envy . Mrs Shah returned to the UK three months later, after her Guardians decided she should be kept there under lock and key. She said the feeling of sunlight on her face was one of the things she missed most during her captivity, adding, 'I used to look out at kids playing and feel an overwhelming sense of envy. 'When you are married at the age of five you no longer live like a normal child. I was deprived of my basic human rights.' After giving birth to a daughter at the age of 20, Mrs Shah said she became determined her child would never endure the horrors she herself had lived through. The law covering forced marriage in Britain makes it a civil rather than a criminal matter, and many of the victims are sent abroad. Those at risk can apply for a court order which bars them or the organisers of the marriage from leaving the country. Violating such an order constitutes contempt of court, which carries a prison sentence of up to two years.  While forced marriages are not recognised as legal in the UK, if victims do not return to Britain then the people responsible cannot be prosecuted.The Government is currently considering a change in the law. Ultimately, her daughter was to be her salvation. Though the years of abuse she had suffered took a toll on Mrs Shah, manifesting as crippling obsessive compulsive disorder, she became interested in studying after watching her daughter's progress through school. To her husband's displeasure, she enrolled in college and took GCSEs. Finally, at the age of 37, she found the strength to leave the man who had made her life a misery, even banning her from smiling because he considered it 'the sign of a loose woman'. In strict Muslim communities divorce remains strictly taboo, and those who do separate from their partners risk being ostracised by their friends and families. While Mrs Shah returned to her parents after dissolving her marriage, the arrangement was not a success and she found herself entirely alone in the world. At her lowest ebb, contemplating suicide, she began composing a goodbye text to her beloved daughter - but couldn't bring herself to abandon the best thing in her life, a child who so obviously needed her. Finding herself outside a church, and ready to turn her back on a religion which had brought her nothing but pain and subjugation, Mrs Shah threw herself on the mercy of a priest. Though she said she was keen to become a Christian, the priest said it was not Islam which had failed Samina - it was people. He made contact with a Muslim woman who provided the sobbing mother with solace, and a bed for the night. Mentor: After ending her own forced marriage, Mrs Shah hopes to help girls understand that Islam does not permit the barbaric practice - and that they too can escape it . Mrs Shah said it was not until she stopped seeing herself through other people's eyes that she felt able to move on from her abusive marriage and take control of her own life. Having reinvented herself as a successful entrepreneur, she now gives talks to women's groups and mentors youngsters in her local area. Above all, she wants to emphasise that forced marriage is completely contrary to both the teachings of Islam and the dignity of human beings. She said: 'Islam safeguards women's rights, and I am delighted that I found the Islam that God sent down - not the one that has been hijacked by the jackals who misrepresent its true teachings.'","Victim tells how her childhood was shockingly ended by the ceremony she mistook for a birthday party .

"London (CNN) -- Britain has some of the best journalism in the world. A number of institutions with noble traditions -- the London Times, the BBC, the Guardian and others -- foster reporting that challenges vested interests and informs citizens in exactly the way that journalism is supposed to do. But the British press also has deep problems, as the phone-hacking affair and the year-long Leveson inquiry into press ethics and practices have revealed. In recent decades editors and proprietors have made themselves virtually unaccountable for what they do, enabling a culture to develop in which the people who are the subjects of stories may be bullied, lied about or intruded upon at will. It is only a minority of journalists who have done this, but the attitude was cynical and ugly, summed up by a News of the World news editor who remarked to a colleague: ""That is what we do. We go out and destroy other people's lives."" The result was a stream of scandals of which phone hacking was only the latest and the worst, and, though journalists hate to admit it, the whole trade is contaminated. News: Brooks, Coulson charged over alleged payments to officials . The report of the Leveson Inquiry, due later this week, is a historic opportunity to clean things up. In an ideal world journalists would not need the kind of regulation he will recommend, but if trust is to be rebuilt it is essential. It is essential, too, because citizens have to be protected against the kinds of violations that have become common, and that have spread misery and distress. What will it change? The first thing we have to acknowledge is that Leveson can only recommend; it is up to the government, parliament and the industry to implement what he suggests. And the British press has been through crises like this before and usually managed to wriggle off the hook. But this time is probably worse than ever before and the newspapers are less in control of the debate than ever before, so change is indeed possible. The challenge to Lord Justice Leveson was to come up with an effective system of regulation that does not undermine the freedom of journalists to do their work in the public interest. And that surely means calling time on the industry's ""self-regulation,"" now acknowledged as a mere fig-leaf. So there will probably be a new body, in all likelihood backed by statute, with the job of ensuring that newspapers and their websites meet basic standards of accuracy and fairness. Hacked Off, the campaign group of which I am director, hopes that it will be very clearly independent of both political influence and of the editors and proprietors. This is not such a great novelty for Britain, first because for years the press has insisted that its own self-regulation regime existed to uphold standards and provide redress (though it did so only selectively) and second because broadcast journalism is regulated in this way (and broadcast journalism happens to be the country's most trusted). To some, however, it will sound ugly, even offensive. We like to think of journalism as unfettered and rambunctious, and British journalists are apt to quote from John Stuart Mill, or to cite the troublemaking examples of William Cobbett and W. T. Stead, to justify their independence from any kind of vetting or control. Opinion: Why media fights back so hard . But change is now vital because journalism has been inflicting too much damage. Too many innocent, ordinary people -- victims of crime, people bereaved in disasters, innocent acquaintances and relatives of the famous -- have been lied about, intruded upon or had their rights trampled on by newspapers. So Britain has a choice: sacrifice the rights of vulnerable people into the future or try to get the press to observe basic standards. It's not really a choice at all. And the new regulation will not be censorship. Lord Justice Leveson is obliged by his terms of reference to make recommendations that support press freedom and in any case he pledged many times that he was not remotely interested in gagging the newspapers. Instead newspapers will be made accountable, after publication, for their errors and failures. They will have to acknowledge them and give redress to those injured. They will be required to abide by a code of practice and face scrutiny, censure and possibly fines for repeated or grievous breaches. And they will have to do something they have never liked to do: learn from their mistakes. For a journalist -- and I am one -- it is in many ways shaming. But we journalists are the first to demand this kind of remedy in any other walk of life where ethics have broken down, be it banking or policing or medical practice. We must be ready to take the medicine we dish out to others, not least because it can and should make us better. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Brian Cathcart.","Phone-hacking revelations revealed problems into UK press, says Brian Cathcart . Cathcart argues Leveson inquiry is historic opportunity to clean things up . He wants scrutiny independent of politicians instead of industry's ""self-regulation"" Newspapers must be more accountable for errors and failures, Cathcart says .",52c4aba28cbb48d8675aaf0abf23e24c53aa7460
"By . Dan Bloom . World football's top 25 officials have had their salaries doubled after a new ethics committee promised to stamp out their bonuses, an investigation has claimed. It is alleged that Fifa - which faces corruption claims over the awarding of the 2022 World Cup to Qatar - also offered to pay its executive committee in wads of cash through a Swiss bank account. The claims today, revealed in a cache of millions of documents leaked to The Sunday Times, are the latest in a growing litany against the governing body of world football. Bumper pay: The 25 members of Fifa's top governing body have had their salaries doubled, it was reported today. Pictured: The executive committee (Exco) during a general assembly at its headquarters in Switzerland . The executive committee led by President Sepp Blatter, Exco for short, is Fifa's most powerful body and numbers 25 top officials from the football world. Britain's representative Jim Boyce is one of Exco's seven vice presidents and has already said he would support a rerun of the 2022 vote if corruption allegations are proven. The revelations come just four months after Fifa promised to clean up allegations of corruption by scrapping bonuses to its committee. A new audit and compliance body was formed in July 2012 and its chief, Domenico Scala, said in February that executives had agreed to scrap the bonuses because they could encourage unethical behaviour. He said Exco was an 'oversight and decision-making body... not responsible for sales,' adding: 'We don’t want to provide a bonus to people overseeing the operations.' But according to the report today in . The Sunday Times, each of the 25 members' salaries has risen from . £59,000 to £118,000 this year after the bonuses - reputedly worth . £44,000 a year - were scrapped. Timing: The revelations during the current World Cup in Brazil come as Fifa President Sepp Blatter - the head of Exco - is firmly in the public eye. Pictured: Blatter (right) watching his home team, Switzerland . Mounting anger: Brazilians have protested in Rio de Janiero over the huge cost of staging the World Cup . June 1, 2014: £3m in 'corrupt' payments . The Sunday Times revealed it had been handed 'millions' of documents which exposed how a top Qatari football official, 65-year-old Mohammed Bin Hammam (right), handed officials £3million worth of cash and global junkets to help secure the 2022 World Cup. MPs called for Qatar to be stripped of the tournament amid an investigation. Qatar hit back, saying it 'always upheld the highest standard of ethics and integrity' and that Bin Hammam 'played no official or unofficial role in Qatar’s 2022 Bid Committee'. June 8: Secret gas deal talks . The newspaper revealed more files detailing how Bin Hammam fixed meetings with the Qatari royal family for at least seven key members of Exco, including Sepp Blatter. Two secret meetings were brokered between Qatari royals and an aide to Thailand's serving Fifa member to discuss a gas deal in the critical final months before the 2022 ballot, it was reported. June 15: Fifa 'ignored high terror risk' Further revelations alleged that Qatar had been deemed at the highest risk of a terrorist attack of any of the 2022 host nations. The documents added to questions over how a nation with scorching summer heat and little footballing tradition won the World Cup. An unnamed Exco member told the newspaper the salary 'doubled to take account of the dropping of the bonus.' The newspaper alleged Exco members enjoy generous expenses - including stays in a £200-a-night hotel in Rio de Janiero during the Brazil World Cup and more than £400 a day in generous expenses. Leaked documents also claimed Exco members were allowed to take their salaries in envelopes full of cash at Fifa's headquarters in Zurich, Switzerland. The timing of the revelations, during the current World Cup in Brazil, is devastating for Mr Blatter as he remains firmly in the public eye. Brazilian authorities are already fighting unrest in large cities including Rio de Janiero over the huge amount spent on the tournament - and the vast profits for Fifa - in a country with extreme poverty. The governing body of world football is highly secretive about the salaries it pays its top officials. Accounts list the total of payments to Fifa's 'key management personnel', which includes not only the 25 Exco members but also directors and other top staff. This figure was £21.3million last year - a rise of £1.6million in a year since 2012. The pay of Fifa President Sepp Blatter and the other 24 members of Exco is now set by a compensation committee led by Mr Scala. Earlier this month the chairman of the Britain's parliamentary committee for Culture, Media and Sport said Fifa needed a complete overhaul. In a BBC interview earlier this month, John Whittingdale said an inquiry three years ago into the 2022 World Cup bidding process had received several allegations of 'potential corrupt payments'. 'Those were swept aside by Fifa, they weren't properly investigated, and that was three years ago,' he said.

"(CNN)Some of the U.S. military personnel being deployed to Liberia to help tackle the Ebola crisis may come into contact with the virus, a Pentagon official said Tuesday. Speaking at a press conference, the head of U.S. Africa Command, Gen. David Rodriguez, said that while the majority of U.S. troops involved in the mission would not be exposed to the disease, those in mobile testing labs could have contact in that environment. ""They're all trained at a very, very high level,"" Rodriguez told reporters of the lab personnel, who constitute a ""separate, specialty element of the force."" The Pentagon has sent three of these mobile labs to Liberia so far, and expects to send more in the coming months, according to Rodriguez. Each mobile lab is staffed by three or four service members, a fraction of the overall military presence in the country. Last week, Pentagon Press Secretary Rear Adm. John Kirby told reporters there was ""no expectation"" that U.S. troops would be ""physically, geographically in a situation where that they should be exposed"" to Ebola, though he admitted that risk to lab technicians is higher than the troops. On Tuesday, Rodriguez emphasized that, ""the health and safety of the team supporting this mission is our priority."" ""We will do everything in our power to address and mitigate the potential risk to our service members, civilian employees, contractors and their families,"" he said. If a service member contracts Ebola while in Liberia, Rodriguez said they would be flown to the United States in a specially outfitted plane to a facility equipped to handle their case. Three American civilians who have so far contracted the disease while in West Africa were similarly evacuated. But the Pentagon insists they are taking all necessary precautions to keep personnel from becoming infected. Troops are completing special training before they deploy and will have to follow strict protocols in the field, which include frequent washing of hands and feet, as well as temperature-taking. They will also have to fill out questionnaires on their physical condition and any symptoms they might be experiencing. Up to 4,000 U.S. military personnel have been approved for deployment in this effort, which Gen. Rodriguez said would cost an estimated $750 million over a six month period.","Some U.S. personnel could be in contact with Ebola in West Africa, Pentagon official says .

"By . Nikki Murfitt . Supermarkets losing £100million a year propping up their online delivery services. Experts say that while supermarkets often charge £3 or £4 for each home delivery, the actual cost to them is £20. As a result, they are effectively paying customers to shop with them. Retail analyst Dave McCarthy said: ‘The transition from in-store retailing to online retailing in the grocery market is losing the industry £100million profit per annum. It costs Tesco around £20 to deliver to their customers whoi pay around £4 for the service . ‘When a customer switches from shopping in a store to shopping online, it is a lot less profitable for the retailer, which suffers a double whammy. The store loses profits from the lost sales and importantly, a contribution to fixed costs such as rates, energy and the store manager’s wages. ‘And when the customer shops online, the retailer incurs extra costs for packing the products, paying transportation costs, wages, fuel and for the cost of the vehicle which is an expensive, multi-temperature-controlled vehicle.’ Morrisons and Tesco are among the big supermarkets who are losing out on home deliveries . Mr McCarthy tells a Channel 4 Dispatches documentary to be screened tomorrow night: ‘Discount supermarkets are growing at twice the rate of online shopping, yet the big four keep investing and chasing online custom. ‘How much trade would these supermarkets lose if they stopped online? The answer is not as much as they are losing out to the growth of discount supermarkets.’ The beleaguered supermarket giants – Tesco, Asda, Sainsbury’s and Morrisons – have seen combined lost sales of more than £3billion in recent years and have slashed thousands of jobs. Last week, Tesco ousted embattled chief executive Philip Clarke after yet another dire profits warning. Last week, Tesco ousted embattled chief executive Philip Clarke after yet another dire profits warning . The success of discount chains such as Lidl and Aldi has meant that middle class shoppers are happy to boast about how savvy they are with their money, and take pride in the fact that they don’t fall victim to the consumerism being promoted by the big four. Mr McCarthy says: ‘As the recession hit, consumers were forced to go elsewhere and as a result they have experimented by trying products in the discount stores and found what they do and don’t like. ‘The discount stores have a compelling offer. They are providing quality and value for money.’ Dispatches quotes customers saying that shopping at Aldi has cut their grocery bill in half without compromising on quality. One said: ‘That was a big surprise. You think because something is cheap then it is probably going to be rubbish quality but it is just the opposite. ‘I used to shop in Sainsbury’s but felt I was being taken for a ride.’","Customers pay £3 for delivery but price to shops is actually £20 .

"Bachmann's New Hampshire team claim they were 'treated as second class citizens' by 'rude' campaign . Bachmann spokesman hit back, saying: 'They want to call names, that's their prerogative' By . Daily Mail Reporter . UPDATED: . 15:54 EST, 26 October 2011 . Presidential Candidate Michele Bachmann registered by mail for New Hampshire's presidential primary after her staff's abrupt resignation last week. With all five of Mrs Bachmann's paid staff members in her New Hampshire office abandoning ship last week, the vying presidential contender could have opted to travel to the Granite state but chose to file by mail instead. Those now former-staffers have complained of receiving a cold shoulder by the candidate's national team, as well as to have been treated rudely. Iowa's 'it': Michele Bachmann has publicly acknowledged keeping her focus on the state of Iowa, choosing to slip an appearance to register for the New Hampshire primary this week . Most of the other presidential candidates have chosen to file in person, finding a campaign opportunity in their appearance. Separate from that crowd, Texas congressman Ron Paul sent a staff member to file on his behalf early Monday morning, though the former Governor of Utah Jon Hunstman arrived himself by the late afternoon in addition to former-governor of Massachusetts Mitt Romney. With Vice-President Joe Biden's appearance, he filed on behalf of both himself and President Obama. Mrs Bachmann has visited New Hampshire twice since beginning her campaign, publicly acknowledging her decision to focus primarily on Iowa. The five former staffers of Mrs Bachmann had said, however, that they hold no ill will toward the Minnesota congresswoman, but they could not continue working for her because the national campaign team had been 'rude, unprofessional, dishonest, and at times cruel' to them. Scroll down for video . Problems: The five former staffers said they could not continue working for Bachmann because her national campaign team had been 'rude, unprofessional, dishonest, and at times cruel' to them . A press release issued by the New Hampshire team also accused the campaign as being 'abrasive, discourteous, and dismissive' of the state's voters. 'These are our neighbors and our . friends, and some within the national team treated them more as a . nuisance than as potential supporters,' the group wrote. The letter went on to tell how they had all been . full-time, paid employees until September 11, when they were asked to . temporarily go 'off payroll' due to financial concerns. Mrs Bachmann's New Hampshire campaign manager, Jeff Chidester, voluntarily took himself off payroll at the beginning of September until the end of the campaign because funds were so poor. 'It saddens this team to see a dedicated . patriot – a person so desperately needed in the White House – . sequestered behind a wall of pretense, guarded by political operatives . consumed by their own egos,' the group wrote. Alice Stewart, Mrs Bachmann's national spokeswoman, responded by labelling the group 'name callers' and admitted the national focus was on Iowa. Stranger: Michele Bachmann has visited New Hampshire just twice since announcing her campaign blaming her absence on the debt limit debate . 'Name calling': Alice Stewart, Mrs Bachmann's spokeswoman, dismissed the allegations . During her latest trip to New Hampshire earlier this . month, she blamed her frequent absence on the August debate in Congress over . raising the nation's debt limit. In an interview with John King on CNN, Ms Stewart responded to the criticism of the national team, of which she is a senior part, by saying: 'That's unfortunate. They want to call names, that's their prerogative. We wish them the best.' 'It is disheartening when members of the staff or volunteers or people who are working with the team decide to communicate with the media as opposed with the campaign,' Ms Stewart continued. 'We haven't heard anything from these people. It is unfortunate they chose to make it in such a public way.' However, the staffers made clear they tried to inform people within the national operation of their concerns well before they issued the press release. Mrs Bachmann's campaign manager, Keith Nahigian, sought to discredit the authenticity of the people behind the letter. 'The unauthorized news release was sent by a person who doesn't even work for the campaign and has never had authority to speak on behalf of the campaign,' he said. 'We are not responding to comments made by a person who was not even a staff member in New Hampshire.' Ms Stewart said that while the New . Hampshire operation was important, winning Iowa was the primary focus . for Mrs Bachmann and her campaign. 'First . and foremost, we have to get through the important first caucus state,' Ms Stewart told CNN. 'That's what she's focused on.' Little chance: Former campaign manager Ed Rollins quit in September, stating, 'I think legitimately it's a Romney-Perry race' Praying for miracle: The latest poll numbers are not good for Mrs Bachmann, pictured with husband Marcus, with support at five per cent . The New Hampshire exodus is the latest staffing dilemma to to hit Mrs Bachmann's campaign. In September, campaign manager Ed Rollins made a high-profile exit, saying the congresswoman's chances of winning the GOP nod had dwindled. He called her the 'third-candidate'  and said: 'I think legitimately it's a Romney-Perry race.' Mr Rollins revealed that his deputy David Polyansky would also stand aside. Earlier this month, seasoned Republican pollster Ed Goeas, who served as an adviser to Mrs Bachmann, and senior policy adviser Andy Parrish left her 2012 campaign. Since winning the Iowa straw poll in August, Mrs Bachmann's poll numbers have been on the slide and according to the latest Gallup poll, constucted between October 3-7, she has just five per cent support for the nomination. Harsh words: The press release which accuses Mrs Bachmann's national team of rudeness . Mitt Romney, on 20 per cent, Herman Cain, 18 per cent, and Rick Perry, 15 per cent, are out in front. Recent polls have also shown that despite earlier success, Mrs Bachmann is now rated no higher than fourth place in the Hawkeye State. In their statement issued on Sunday, . the former New Hampshire staffers also tried to clarify confusion that arose on Friday . when Mrs Bachmann's national spokeswoman disputed reports of a staff . shake-up. The group . said Mr Chidester quit . on Thursday following several 'serious incidents' during Mrs Bachmann's recent trip to the Granite State, but he informed the national campaign that others might be . interested in staying if national officials reached out to them. The other four staffers quit on Friday after their efforts to get in touch with the national team to discuss their concerns were ignored, they said. The group says that 'through all this chaos' they were, 'deceived, . left out of the loop regarding key decisions, and relegated to . second-class citizens within a campaign in which they were the original . members'.","Bachmann's New Hampshire team claim they were 'treated as second class citizens' by 'rude' campaign .

"When Secretary of State John Kerry first took office he talked of changing Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's calculus. Assad ""needs to know that he can't shoot his way out of this,"" Kerry said in March at a Rome meeting with members of the Syrian opposition. When he and Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov first conceived the idea of bringing the regime and the opposition together for peace talks in Geneva, they believed strengthened international support for both the political opposition and rebel forces would leave the Syrian leader ready to negotiate his own ouster. U.S. policy since then has had the opposite effect. Assad's calculus has indeed changed. The political opposition is on the verge of collapse, rebel groups now having to battle the growing strength of Islamist forces on the ground, and his regime is at the center of implementing an international deal to rid the country of chemical weapons. He heads to Geneva believing the false narrative that he is even more powerful. As his forces continue to kill thousands each week from barrel bombs with impunity, Assad has no reason to think he can't shoot his way out of the crisis. Representatives of Syria's main opposition group voted Saturday to attend next week's peace talks in Geneva. Leading up to the vote, the opposition was bitterly divided on whether to attend at all. Members of the opposition suggest that the United States is setting them up to fail by not providing the Free Syrian Army with sufficient resources to change the balance of power on the ground. ""Is the opposition being set up for success by United States, not just to participate in a conference that will lead to a political solution, but being empowered to ensure success of the stated objectives of Geneva?"" asked Oubai Shahbandar, a senior adviser to the opposition. ""It is the position of the opposition that you cannot have a successful political process if the U.S. doesn't also increase its support. Right now, the regime thinks its winning. They think they have successfully avoided military strikes, western sanctions and repercussions for continued war crimes. It is these components that make any successful outcomes of Geneva unlikely,"" Shahbandar said. For months, U.S. Ambassador to Syria Robert Ford has shuttled to Turkey to meet with members of the Syrian National Council. In preparing for Geneva, Ford and other U.S. officials repeatedly urged the opposition to present a transition plan that saw the group playing a major role in a post al-Assad government, which could include some elements of the current government. Now the group is being implored to just show up. The Obama administration maintains it still believes al-Assad should step down. But rather than hand over power, he is talking about running for re-election this spring in what is all but certain to be a fraudulent election. And the opposition, whose legitimacy is mostly conferred upon them by the international community, appears to be in no position to force his hand. ""The Syrian opposition is in a space capsule heading toward Geneva and breaking up in the atmosphere and this may be one of the West's biggest failures,"" says Salman Sheikh, director of the Brookings Doha Center. ""Geneva has put unbearable pressure on an opposition that has always lacked unity and direction and this has a great bearing for any process the international powers are looking to launch,"" Sheikh said. Having lacked resolve to either use force against al-Assad or arm the opposition, and with no coming together of the Security Council on even the growing humanitarian crisis, the Obama administration now has fewer tools in the toolbox. What's left is the diplomatic ""fig leaf"" of Geneva, which few people besides Kerry believe is more than an effort to check the diplomatic box and manage some sort of response to the Syrian crisis, rather than demonstrating the mettle to find a solution. ""Despite how everyone tries to dress it up, this is not the right kind of place for the U.S. to be on what is shaping up to be the biggest humanitarian disaster of this century and which is promising to have the largest loss of life and bloodiest conflict the Middle East has seen,"" Sheikh said. ""But there is no alternative. It is all we have, so now have to go through it and hope for something after Geneva. I think it is a misreading of the situation and the whole region. I'm not sure they can stand many more months of this while the ground churns,"" Sheikh said. Syria's ghost homes, ravaged by war . Moreover, there is no agreement in terms of what the parameters of the Geneva talks are. The United States, United Nations and other Western and Arab countries want talks on a transitional government. The Syrian regime, Russia and Iran - who won't be there as a participant but with thousands of fighters on the ground helping the regime will be the elephant in the room - believe Geneva is about fighting the growing Islamic insurgency and rehabilitating al-Assad. With al Qaeda forces continuing to capture territory and even checkpoints on the border with Turkey, narrative of al-Assad as savior is stronger. Even as Washington is turning up the pressure on the opposition to join the talks, the administration is significantly lowering expectations. U.S. officials concede merely getting the opposition and the regime in the room would be a success. ""When we first conceptualized the conference, we believed that we would be able to help form a transitional government and that would be that,"" one senior State Department official acknowledged. ""But we understand achieving political progress is more challenging eight months later."" The first direct talks between the two sides after three years of conflict would be a milestone. To jumpstart negotiations over a political transition, Kerry said he and Lavrov are seeking confidence-building measures, including possible local ceasefires, access for delivery of humanitarian aid and exchange of prisoners. Agreement on these issues would also be no small feat. With progress toward a transitional government highly unlikely, the conference will now focus as much on the humanitarian crisis as it will on discussions about Syria's political future. ""The humanitarian situation has taken on a greater importance. It is an enormous crisis and it is appropriate to focus on that,"" another senior U.S. official said. ""We still have a desire to see a transitional government and nobody is giving up with that. But we are also thinking about what our other objectives are,"" the official said. 81 days captive in Syria . Having accepted the fact that Geneva is not likely be a turning point for the conflict, the administration now says it hopes Geneva will be the beginning of a ""process."" But there is wide trepidation among the Syrian opposition about a process that is open-ended and fails to stop the violence and suffering. ""Nothing will happen overnight but it can't be indefinite, Shahbandar said. ""The regime will drag this process on while it continues to bomb cities and increase its starvation campaign."" In addition, any future effort to find a political solution to the Syrian conflict must focus more on broadening the participation of that process to include more Syrians with influence on the ground. ""The biggest failure of Geneva is that the regime and opposition can't turn the corner. They can't because they don't represent the majority of Syrians,"" Sheikh said. Revolutionary councils inside Syria, the backbone of the civil resistance, have been providing services to the people and are increasingly becoming the de-facto representation of the Syrian opposition. But those doing the work on the ground, whether it be political or fighting, are not involved in the political process under way. He lost his leg in war and now helps others . Sheikh, who meets frequently with a cross section of Syrians said that with all of its planning for a post al-Assad Syria, the international community has yet to help build an indigenous opposition in a meaningful way. ""Alawites, Christians, tribal leaders, rebel commanders and business associations all need to be brought in and they aren't,"" Sheikh said. ""If I can do that in a little old think tank, how come the international community hasn't been able to support that?"" Damascus softens its stance as next Geneva talks near .","Assad has no reason to think he can't shoot his way out of crisis, Labott says . Opposition suggests U.S. is setting them up to fail .

"What happens now? Australian officials have said they don't think missing Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 is in the patch of the southern Indian Ocean where underwater pings were picked up last month. Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott said in early April that authorities were ""very confident"" the signals were coming from the plane's flight recorders, raising hopes of closure among some of the families of the 239 people on board the passenger jet. But after spending weeks scouring the bottom of the ocean roughly 1,600 kilometers (1,000 miles) off Western Australia with a high-tech unmanned submarine, the searchers have drawn another blank, deepening the mystery surrounding the Boeing 777's fate. Officials say they are still trying to figure out the source of the signals that led the search for the past seven weeks. More than 11 weeks after Flight 370 dropped off radar screens over Southeast Asia on a scheduled flight to Beijing, officials in charge of the hunt are drawing a line through the ping-centered search and moving on to the next phase. Where does the search go next? The underwater search area guided by the pings covered more than 850 square kilometers (330 square miles). With that zone now ruled out, Australian authorities, who have been coordinating the search in the southern Indian Ocean, say attention will shift to a new area as large as 60,000 square kilometers. That's roughly the size of West Virginia. ""The search will be a major undertaking,"" the Australian Transport Safety Bureau (ATSB) said this week. ""The complexities and challenges involved are immense, but not impossible."" The underwater search will remain in the same overall region, as officials are basing their focus on an analysis of satellite, radar and other data that concludes the plane ended up somewhere along an arc stretching into the southern Indian Ocean. ""What has not changed at this stage is the belief that, after weeks of research and re-analysis, that the Inmarsat data is correct and that they are looking broadly in the right area,"" said Geoffrey Thomas, the editor in chief of Airlineratings.com, referring to the satellite data provided by the British company Inmarsat. ""Now clearly, we were hoping that the pings would narrow that broad area down to a narrow one, but that has not been the case, and now we have to unfortunately go the long road,"" Thomas told CNN. Will they start searching the new area immediately? No. In fact, it hasn't yet been fully mapped out. The ATSB said this week that it's reviewing existing information from experts in order to refine the new zone. Meanwhile, a specialized Chinese ship, the Zhu Kezhen, has begun mapping the ocean floor in some areas already picked out by the ATSB. A contracted commercial survey vessel will join those efforts next month. It's unclear how deep the water is in these areas because ""it's never been mapped,"" Australian Deputy Prime Minister Warren Truss said earlier this month. Officials say depths are likely to exceed 6,000 meters (20,000 feet). The survey will take about three months and ""give us crucial knowledge of the seafloor terrain needed to begin the underwater search,"" the ATSB said. Who will do the actual searching? That's still being figured out. The Bluefin-21, the robotic submersible supplied by the U.S. Navy that has been searching the area where the pings were detected, has reached the end of its mission. Search officials are regrouping and preparing to identify and deploy other high-tech equipment. But that's going to take some time -- up to two months, if not longer, according to Australian authorities. Officials say they want the next phase of the underwater search, which could take up to a year, to be led by a single private contractor who will bring together and manage several underwater assets in the search zone. Search coordinators say they are looking for sonar equipment that can be towed by a ship, an autonomous underwater vehicle with a mounted sonar device and optical imaging equipment. Some towed sonar devices, such as the U.S. Navy's Orion, can transmit data to the surface in real-time. They also have the capability of scanning a larger area than the Bluefin, which was limited to about 40 square kilometers during each mission. Only a handful of companies have such devices. Australian authorities say they plan to post their request for tenders for the next phase of the search in the coming days. Who's going to pay for it? That's another issue that isn't clear yet. Australia has estimated the next phase of the search will cost $60 million, with the breakdown of exactly who's going to pay for what yet to be announced. While 26 countries have participated in the hunt for the missing plane, Malaysia, China and Australia have held high-level talks about the future of the search. Malaysia is where the plane is from, most of the people on the flight were Chinese, and Australia had six passengers on board and is closest to the remote part of the Indian Ocean where searchers have focused their hunt. The United States has contributed a range of assets to the search so far, including the Bluefin-21, which costs an estimated $40,000 a day to operate. Are the searchers still looking in the right place? Australian officials say they remain confident in the conclusion -- reached by a team of experts from Boeing and aviation authorities around the world, including the United States and Europe -- that Flight 370 ended its journey in the southern Indian Ocean. Despite questions from independent experts, Inmarsat says it stands by its analysis of a series of communications between the plane and the company's satellite system that provided a key part of the conclusion about the jetliner's path. Earlier this week, Malaysian authorities released the satellite data from Inmarsat, meeting a long-standing request of some passengers' families who were unsatisfied by authorities' explanation of the plane's fate. Independent experts are now studying the data to see whether they agree with the official view.",The new search area is roughly the size of West Virginia .

"If it was up to Kanye West, we'd all be strutting around in flesh-coloured body stockings next season. As ridiculous as it may sound, that may well be the case as the musician-come-designer has received an abundance of praise for his range for Adidas from fashion editors, authorities, and influencers. The collection made its way down the runway on the first day of New York Fashion Week yesterday, comprising of full body stockings, see-through skin-coloured crop tops and visible nude pants. It's certainly a new take on underwear as outerwear - one certainly not for the faint hearted. Scroll down for video . Deni Kirkova, 24, from London, stepped out on a London High Street to find out what the reaction from onlookers would be . She wore a High Street makeshift version of the types of outfits seen on the Kanye West X Adidas catwalk, right . The Kanye West Adidas Fall 2015 collection received an abundance of praise from fashion elite - but do the public agree it's a hot look? To win praise for his fashion is certainly a step forward for Kanye - now Femail are testing whether his clothes will be as popular with the public. Writer Deni Kirkova, 24, from London, trialled the full flesh-coloured body stocking look, stepping out on a London High Street  to find out what the reaction from onlookers would be. She paired an American Apparel bralet (£12.50), crop top (£10), leggings (£14) and - of course - a £6 pair of pants, from Marks & Spencer, worn over the top, all in a beige flesh tone, topping off the look with a Kim K style parka jacket from Topshop. Speaking about her outfit, and whether she thought it worked, Deni said: 'The problem is visible pants. It's quite funny to walk around dressed like this now, and it's a bit of a laugh, but I wouldn't dare go out like this seriously. 'A nude crop top and leggings, though, could work. You'd have to tone this down a notch to take it from catwalk to High Street. 'I'm quite surprised that people on the street generally liked my outfit to be honest - some fashion know-it-alls praised how bold it was, noting the Kanye influence, and said that the jacket and lipstick went well with the all-nude look. 'Some though, of course, said that the pants were too much.' Deni paired an American Apparel bralet, crop top, leggings and  pair of M&S pants worn over the top, all in a beige flesh tone, with a parka . Deni's look was inspired by Adidas Originals x Kanye West Yeezy collection seen in New York on Thursday. The designer's wife Kim Kardashian, 34, turned up wearing an ensemble from the range. She liked the look so much, she even posted an Instagram photo of herself, adding: 'My look for the Yeezy show!!!!!! Yeezy head to toe!!!!!' Critics similarly seemed to enjoy Kanye's latest fashion offerings with Vogue saying: 'Kanye West's New collection with Adidas lives up to the hype.' He had the fashion bible's editor-in-chief, Anna Wintour, and top designer Alexander Wang sitting front row. Kanye's wife Kim Kardashian showed up to the event wearing a brown body stocking with a grey crop top and a camo jacket . Everyone from builders to couples and fashionistas to old ladies seemed to like the bold look, much to Deni's surprise .

'It's quite funny to walk around dressed like this now, but I wouldn't dare go out like this seriously' A review posted on the fashion magazine's website said: 'Hems were raw and frayed, tops billowy, bottoms either skintight to slide into newly unveiled suede stiletto boots or cinched and ready to be tucked into aforementioned Boosts. 'There were immaculate flak vests and officer sweaters that looked like they’ve actually taken shrapnel, and everything was said to be unisex... On display, in rigid lines of expressionless youth, it was at the very least satisfyingly instigative for a line of sportswear.' Refinery 29  noted that Kanye's collection probably would sell well saying: 'It was a lineup of oversized jackets, sweatshirts, sweaters, and leggings, interspersed with Vanessa Beecroft-esque nude-colored underwear. 'A camo parka that Kim Kardashian also wore was a highlight, and we thought the oversized backpack was a clever accessory that'll probably make it into a healthy stack of editorials.' Kanye claims that he wanted the collection to be made up of 'solutions based clothing,' saying, 'I don't want the clothes to be the life, I want the clothes to help the life.' It is also thought that it will have a relatively low price point compared to other designer clothes meaning the pieces can be snapped up by his fans. Now that the fully nude spray-on look has won approval from fashion darlings and the man on the street, will you be trying it out? Deni says maybe a nude crop top and leggings could work - without the pants. You'd have to tone this down a notch .

Robert Bastin, lighting a cigarette outside Exeter Magistrates' Court where he admitted stealing a retro penny farthing outside a house in Honiton . A 20-year-old man is facing jail after he stole a penny farthing bicycle so he could get back home - 14 miles away. Robert Bastin stole the bike outside a house in Honiton after Christmas drinks with his brother, a court heard. The jobless labourer rode the stolen bike 14 miles to his flat. The court heard that Bastin decided against returning the bike to Honiton following the theft and instead attempted to sell it on eBay. Defence lawyer Peter Woodley told a court today: 'He was trying to get home. He had had a Christmas Day drink with his brother and it looked like a good idea. 'But a penny farthing is not the easiest thing to return to its owner.' On his eBay listing, Bastin claimed: 'not really my thing prefer my unicycle'. He also maintained that he had only used it three times since new. Devon and Cornwall Police saw the listing on January 12 and placed a £75 bid on the bike. The court heard that Bastin accepted the bid, unaware that it was an undercover police officer. He insisted that the buyer paid cash and collected the bike from his home. Bastin was arrested and the penny farthing was returned to its owner. A penny farthing bicycle similar to the one stolen by Robert Bastin. The retro edition is built by Hawk Cycles in Derby . Robert Bastin stole the bike from Honiton and rode it to his flat in Exeter . Robert Bastin was ordered to return to Exeter Magistrates' Court next month where he will be sentenced . Bastin, of Honiton, Devon, admitted stealing the bike while on bail for other offences. He also admitted aggravated vehicle taking and not having any insurance or licence on December 6. Exeter magistrates court heard that Bastin was riding a motor bike at 5am on the A30 near Exeter airport at speed. The penny farthing was one of the first ever bikes manufactured when it was introduced in 1870. The bicycle received its name due to its distinctive wheels which resembled Victorian penny and farthing coins. It was invented by James Starley and was unusual because the pedals were fixed directly to the front wheel. The penny farthing had solid rubber wheels and a very high centre of gravity - making it very unstable and difficult to ride. It also did not have brakes or suspension. Production eventually ceased in 1878. A new version of the historic bicycle was developed by Hawks Cycles in 2004. It features steel caliper brakes and a modern steel alloy frame costing £150. Police said his riding was 'erratic and wobbly' and he was doing around 20mph over the speed limit before he rode through a red light and through a No Entry sign. Police did not pursue him because they felt it would be unsafe to do so. Later Bastin was arrested by police who discovered DNA evidence linked to the crime from a motorcycle helmet and his clothes. Mr Woodley said the joyriding offence happened at 5am when the main road was 'relatively clear but said it was not the 'worst case of excessive speed' or dangerous driving. He said the jobless labourer was not coping with life over Christmas after losing his job and splitting up from his partner and young child. 'He had no money and was not thinking straight,' said Mr Woodley who said the court had the power to imprison him for a maximum of 12 months. The magistrates ordered an all-options pre-sentencing report - including custody. Bastin was bailed to return to court next month for sentencing.",Robert Bastin claimed he was selling the penny farthing because he preferred his unicycle .

But a farmer's son from Kent has done just that after he started developing unique fruit crisps in his university digs and is now exporting them around the world. Charlie Fermor has now sold more than one million packets of his healthy snack made from apples and pears. Real McCoy: Farmer Charlie Fermor (pictured) dreamt up and tested making apple crisps in his student digs and is now exporting them around the world . Big apple: Recent orders of Charlie's crisps include 100,000 packs to Australia and 40,000 to China . The 25-year-old has taken orders for 100,000 packs from Australia, 40,000 from China and 10,000 from the UAE, with the business set to net him over a million pounds in 2013. Charlie began experimenting with making the fruit crisps - the only ones of their kind in the UK - while studying agricultural business management at university in Reading. He turned his student accommodation into a makeshift lab and bought a dehydrator device to dry out slices of the fruit as he experimented with apples in between lectures. He has so far refused to supply British supermarkets because of . issues with pricing, preferring to build up relationships with smaller . retailers. Simple: The product contains one simple ingredient - the great British apple . Foreign exports: This load of apples is destined for the Chinese market, which has already ordered tens of thousands of packets . 'There was a spare in my university house in my last year . there so thought experimenting in making the crisps would be a good way . of making some use of it.' he said. 'I had some mixed results to begin with but it turned out quite well. 'We have had a lot of interest in the fruit crisps. 'We are making the product ourselves, which is increasingly rare, and that’s something we pride ourselves on. 'There has been a great response to what we have done and we can’t really keep up with demand at the moment. 'We’ll continue to target new markets, that’s what we are doing with . exporting the crisps to other countries as well as getting them into the . schools. Home: Charlie in the family orchard with the raw material and the farm is expecting the fruit crisp enterprise to make over a million pounds next year . From tree to machine: But it all started for Charlie when he started drying apples in his student house . 'But at this stage we are avoiding the supermarkets and looking out for smaller retailers.' After finishing his degree at the University of Reading in 2008, Charlie used his newfound knowledge to develop his brand of crisps at Perry Court Farm, near Ashford, Kent. He visited famous American fruit-growing states such as Oregon and California to learn about processing techniques. Returning to the UK Charlie used some savings to buy his own equipment and set up production in an on-site cold store on the farm using the apples from the orchards. Taking on the world: The crisps, made of apple and pears are proving very popular but will not be sold in supermarkets . That was when the business really started to take off and Charlie hasn’t looked back since. After a trade show six months ago more and more retailers from countries across the globe are now getting in touch with Perry Court Farm about the tasty crisps. The global chain Whole Foods Market snapped up the snacks for their five London shops as well as many other smaller retailers across the country. The tasty crisps, which sell for 50 pence a pack, have proved popular with school tuck shops, as one packet counts as one of your five-a-day.","Charlie Fermor has taken an order of 100,000 packs from Australia alone and hopes to make £1m next year .

The video, which was created in 2009 by YouTube star Michelle Phan, offers viewers a step-by-step guide to creating the perfect plastic look and includes everything from finding the ideal eyeshadow shades - pink, blue and white - to sourcing the best accessories - anything pink, of course. While recreating the look on her own face, Phan throws in a series of helpful tips such as: 'Barbie's skin is flawless so start off with acne serum that reduces blemishes and large pores.' Scroll down for video . Michelle's millions: The Barbie tutorial has been watched  more than 57 million times . Spot the difference! Phan (right) takes less than ten minutes to transform herself into the 'perfect plastic' Barbie . She even offers tips on how to create Barbie's 'tiny nose', advising viewers to 'contour' their nose in order to make it appear smaller and more doll-like. Starting the tutorial from scratch, without a scrap of make-up on, it takes Phan less than ten minutes to complete the entire look - including the time spent putting on her bouncy blonde wig. The video currently has 57 million views - a total which is growing by the hour and remains un-matched by any other beauty-based tutorial on the site. And it's not just the Barbie tutorial that has captured the attention of YouTube fans around the globe. Phan, who currently has more than seven million subscribers to her beauty channel, also boasts similarly impressive viewing figures on two of her Lady Gaga-inspired tutorials. 'Lady Gaga Bad Romance Look' and 'Lady Gaga Poker Face Tutorial' have received 47 million and 34 million view respectively - numbers which will no doubt continue to grow as viewers search for Halloween costume inspiration.

"By . Emily Sheridan . UPDATED: . 09:56 EST, 18 January 2012 . Coronation Street has sparked a storm of protest from viewers after an episode showed a child being smacked. Hundreds took to web forums and Twitter to express outrage at the scene which features Faye being hit by her adoptive mother’s boyfriend Owen Armstrong. The builder, played by Ian Puleston-Davies, loses his temper after the ten-year-old schoolgirl deliberately poisons the  fish in his pond. He is seen whacking 10-year-old Faye, played by Ellie-Louise Leach, on the back of the legs as she winches in pain. Controversial: Owen Armstrong (Ian Puleston-Davies) goes to slap Faye (Ellie Leach) in a scene from Coronation Street . Punishment: The 10-year-old winches in pain as Owen strikes her legs . Monday's episode attracted 9.5million viewers and has led to a small number of complaints to Ofcom and ITV. But many more fans used social networks and blogging sites to express their disgust at show’s producers. One web forum poster described the character’s actions as 'psychotic'. Another said: 'He was really laying into her, or that was the writers' intent.' An angrier fan added: 'Don’t think it should have been shown. Not necessary in this life today. No need for it.' Since the Children’s Act came into effect in January 2005, parents are legally allowed to smack their children. But use of 'excessive force', which cause visible bruising, graze, scratches, minor swellings or cuts, could result in assault charges. The child-smacking seen left some views feeling uncomfortable, while others complained to Ofcom . One Twitter user did not believe that there was anything to complain about . The furore appears to be a sign of the times. Even a few years ago, similar scenes are unlikely to have raised as many eyebrows. It also reflects that the issue of smacking children is still a huge taboo in society. Coronation Street, along with other prime-time soaps, regularly shows much more violent and controversial scenes – albeit featuring adults - which generate little comment. These have recently included the rape of Carla Connor by her partner Frank Foster, a hostage drama which ended with escaped prisoner Tony Gordon shooting dead his cellmate and an explosive tram crash which left several characters dead. Since joining the soap last January, Faye has been something of a problem child and has been seen trying to disrupt her mother’s budding romance with Owen. The focus of many complaints is that Owen is not the child’s father but the boyfriend of her mother Anna Windass, played by Debbie Rush. While many objected to the actual smack, some critics said it would have only been appropriate for her mother  to discipline her in such a way. One Twitter user wrote: 'Owen should never smacked Faye as she wasn't his child but she deserved a smack.' Staff from children’s charity the NSPCC have said they are glad the show's producers have raised the debate. Troublemaker: Owen chastised Faye after she poisoned his fish pond . Spokesman Phillip Noyes told Mail Online: 'We all accept that parents have to be in charge and that clear and consistent boundaries are essential for children and young people to have a secure and happy childhood. 'But evidence shows that smacking is not an effective form of punishment and sets a bad example, especially for children who have a troubled past as in this storyline. 'It teaches children that violence is an answer and it undermines the trusting relationship between a child and their carer. Young people tell us it leaves them feeling frightened and confused but often doesn’t actually deter them from repeating what they were smacked for. Under the 2004 Children's Act, which . came into force in January 2005, mild smacking is allowed but any . punishment which causes visible bruising, grazes, scratches, minor . swellings or cuts can result in legal action. Those who break the law can be punished with up to five years in jail. 'And for a minority of bad parents who . go well beyond smacking and seriously harm their children, it is all too . often used as an excuse to social services, the police and the courts.' The plotline was announced in November but it sparked little controversy at the time.

A Coronation Street spokesman said: 'We most certainly don’t condone Owen’s actions – as will be seen by the ramifications of the slap, and the effect it has on his relationship.' An ITV spokesman said: 'The episode and subsequent episodes do not condone the slap and it has far reaching ramifications for the character of Owen. ‘That said we have no problem with sparking a healthy debate on this issue.' Actor Puleston-Davies said he and scriptwriters had approached the smacking issue cautiously.He said: 'I think any controversial subject handled in the right way is good controversy not bad controversy. ‘I know it was talked about within the writing group and with the producers at length, so they were very careful. 'I was very aware that I wanted to go through the script with a fine-tooth comb. ‘From the moment it was suggested, they took it very carefully and very slowly, so it took a long time to reach the script stage, and rightly so. I'm happy with the finished result.' Ructions: The ramifications of the slap will lead Anna Windass (Debbie Rush) to end her relationship with Owen . MP John Hemming said that he agreed with smacking as a form of punishment. He told the Mirror: 'There is a line when it comes to these things, and the main thing is what is best for the child. 'Parents are best placed to decide what is best. Smacking, when used responsibly, can work in the child’s best interests.' He added: 'How can you make it illegal for a parent to slap their child on the wrist? The Government should think carefully before making any changes.'

"Cairo, Egypt (CNN) -- Reports conflicted Wednesday over whether the 84-year-old former president of Egypt, Hosni Mubarak, was clinically dead. The state-run Middle East News Agency, citing medical sources, said he was declared clinically dead shortly after arriving late Tuesday at a military hospital in Cairo, where he had been taken after suffering a stroke and cardiac arrest earlier in the day. But Gen. Mamdouh Shaheen, a member of the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces, told CNN, ""He is not clinically dead as reported, but his health is deteriorating and he is in critical condition."" Fast facts on the life of Hosni Mubarak . Mubarak was taken by helicopter to the military hospital in the Maadi suburb of Cairo, Shaheen said. ""He had a heart attack and his heart stopped and he was saved by electric shocks, then placed on respirator,"" he said. ""His pulse is 40. He then got a brain clot. He is NOT clinically dead as reported but his health is deteriorating and he is in critical condition."" And Mubarak's lawyer, Fareed El Deeb, told CNN, ""He has been in a coma for hours now. He has had water on the lungs for 10 days now and his blood pressure is down today, which obstructed his breathing and forced doctors to put him on a respirator. He was given medicine intravenously to relieve the brain clot, and electric shocks were used to revive him but there was no substantial response. He is not dead as reported."" El Deeb added that Mubarak's wife, Suzanne, was at his side. He blamed SCAF for not having moved Mubarak last week from the prison to the hospital. Adel Saeed, the official spokesman of the Egyptian prosecutor, had said earlier, ""We were informed by prison authority that Mubarak's heart has stopped and they used electric shocks and CPR to resurrect him. He is now on an artificial respirator and doctors from the armed forces and International Medical Center will inspect him."" Nile TV reported that Mubarak had suffered a stroke. He was taken from Tora prison hospital to Maadi military hospital, El Deeb told CNN. ""He has suffered a stroke, but he is not dead."" The prosecutor and the military council denied Mubarak had been moved. His health had been reported in decline since he was ousted as president of Egypt in February 2011 and found guilty of charges related to the killings of hundreds of anti-government demonstrators during the revolution. Last week, an Interior Ministry spokesman said he was comatose; the spokesman said he suffered from high blood pressure, irregular heartbeats and difficulty breathing. ""We should be skeptical,"" said Fouad Ajami, a senior fellow at Stanford University's Hoover Institution. ""There's a great Arab expression I like and it asks the following question: When you're told that someone is dead, you say, 'Is he dead and buried, or just dead?' I think we are in the middle of this kind of situation."" ""Clinically dead is not a phrase that is commonly used, but when it is used, what it usually means is that someone is brain dead,"" said CNN Senior Medical Correspondent Elizabeth Cohen. ""In the United States, we would call this person dead because they have no brain activity."" Meanwhile, crowds jammed Tahrir Square once again on Wednesday. But their focus this time was not on Mubarak. Instead, it was on the power grab by the Egyptian military, which last week issued a constitutional decree that stripped the position of president of much of its power after a top court dissolved the parliament. Those moves were followed by the nation's first presidential election, which pitted Muslim Brotherhood candidate Mohammed Morsi against Mubarak's former prime minister, Ahmed Safik. Final results have not been announced. ""It's a media stunt to divert attention from the constitutional decree,"" said Taha Shaker, a demonstrator in the square. ""If he's really dead, it won't make a difference. We've started a sit-in and won't leave unless the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces leaves unconditionally."" ""I've come from far away. I'm not leaving until Morsi swears the oath in front of the legitimately elected parliament,"" said demonstrator Sayed Ahmed. ""I don't care about Mubarak. These are games played by the intelligence services."" ""If he's really dead, its God's will,"" said Nasser Shaaban, another demonstrator. ""I would hope he lives to see the new president."" Outside Maadi Military Hospital, shortly before midnight Tuesday, there was no additional security. Instead, there were a few policemen outside the main gate and two military police inside the gate. Across the street perhaps a half-dozen journalists sat on the curb smoking cigarettes. Have you witnessed demonstrations in the Arab world? Tell us what you see. Follow coverage on CNN Arabic .

"(CNN) -- Ordinarily, being ranked as the worst modern president of the United States would be considered unfortunate. For you Mr. President, that's the good news. As painful as it is to note, your presidency has not yet hit bottom. You've got a long way to go in your descent. Everywhere you walk, Mr. President, the world unravels. Americans are whispering that each political missile you fire seems to hit not its target but our own house. You have undone the core idea you've advanced, that a larger public sector can save us. You are becoming the one-man Keystone Cops of an experiment in weakness and incompetent government. Your Veterans Administration is a dysfunctional mess. Some veterans who have lived through war have not survived contact with your VA. Your immigration agents are changing diapers and crying for fresh underwear for detained immigrants awaiting deportation. Your IRS has been accused of targeting political opponents, and your best defense is their ineptitude: They lose their e-mails and files. Your own signature initiative, the Affordable Care Act, has turned on you. You've repeatedly delayed and altered the law, gluing and taping together, on the fly, the health care of an anxious nation. Begala: What's behind Boehner's nutty lawsuit threat . Your Supreme Court is telling you to read the manual that came with your office: You are not allowed to run a Nixonian presidency. In three years, you've suffered numerous humiliating and unanimous reversals of your executive authority. You are protected by the thinly manned barricades of an attorney general who refuses to investigate misconduct in your executive offices. Four out of five Americans believe the government you would like to expand is corrupt, a view that is a 7-point increase from the last year of the Bush administration. You are fortunate you cannot be impeached because of the cost to our exhausted, divided country. If you were a car manufactured by GM, not the president who bailed it out, you would be recalled for your defects. In foreign affairs, you have undone one of the great accomplishments of the 20th century: You have resuscitated the Soviet Union. A two-bit KGB thug named Putin has been kicking sand in the face of your country. In the absence of American leadership, the Middle East has devolved into chaos, and you are reduced to unpalatable choices: Either you negotiate with our Iranian enemies or abandon our allies, if we still have any, to jihadist wildfires that threaten Israel's borders and set desert sands aflame. Boehner: Why we must sue the President . Young people who voted for you to earn a better life than their parents are now living with their parents. Our nation has the lost the hope you promised us. We fear our freedom is in decline: A 48% plurality feel our best days are in the past. Even the one thing you have been good at, Mr. President -- politics -- has abandoned you. You have now been reduced to pathetically small political ""listening tours."" Even on such an inconsequential stage, you are tone-deaf, incapable of striking the right chords: You tell your audiences you are there to tell them that you are listening. You have always been more popular than your policies. Despite your stumbling, we have loved your bright smile and intellectual aura. But now, we are beginning to notice; you laugh too hard at your own jokes. Behind the smile, we see an ego inflated beyond merit. Your intellectual detachment, we now find, was merely cluelessness. The distance between what you've promised and done has grown too large for us to blame anyone else. Kohn: Boehner, do your job instead . Is this as bad as it can get? Actually, no, Mr. President. The road ahead is worse for you. Even your supporters will soon say publicly what we are all thinking privately. In days to come, it will become increasingly cool to snicker and then laugh at your presidency. Disagreement is not the cruelest cut in politics; it is ridicule. Politicians who have survived everything else are done in ultimately by laughter. The gristliest moment for an incumbent is not when voters express their anger. There is respect, even in those dark days. What an incumbent never wants to hear from a voter is pity. Your worst day will be when a voter says, ""Poor President Obama. He's done the best he can."" When that day comes, Mr. President, your favorable rating will crash another 10 points into the basement. Democratic candidates will not only ignore you, as they now do, they will turn on you. Hillary Clinton will betray you. That will start a war within your party as candidates like Elizabeth Warren and Jerry Brown rush to defend you. If they depose the Clintons, mere anarchy will be loosed upon the Democratic world. At this moment, our emperor is naked, but no one has yet said it publicly. That will change soon. When it is too sad to cry about our presidents, America laughs. That's what will really hurt.

"They've been employing a recent display of frugality, in keeping with the scale of the economic crisis facing Spain. And it seems the Spanish royal family's new austere stance isn't about to change - even for the most important event in the past 40 years. Although plans have not yet been announced, it appears that the imminent coronation of Prince Felipe could also be a . rather modest affair. Crown Prince Felipe of Spain and Princess Letizia of Spain visited a students' residence in Madrid earlier today, as news emerged of the low-key scale of the king-in-waiting's plans for an austere coronation . The event, which is understood to be taking place on June 19, will be a secular event and will instead . feature just a simple proclamation, as well as a military procession, in front of . Spanish politicians. Palace and government spokesmen have already said . no foreign dignitaries will be invited to the ceremony, largely . due to the late notice given to plan the event. Even Prince Felipe’s father, King Juan Carlos, has signalled he does not intend to be at the ceremony to see his son take over his throne. But . fervent royalists have attacked the plans, saying a low-key affair . would waste a rare opportunity to showcase Spain on the global stage. Monarchist . newspaper ABC said the austerity policy threatened to tarnish the . handover, claiming in an editorial: 'Unless we see a sudden change in . strategy that could save the celebration, Spain looks set to miss out on . an historic opportunity to project its image abroad.' Political . leaders are also said to be trying to persuade the royal family to . change its mind about the foreign dignitaries, although observers say it . has probably been left too late. But a palace spokesman said there would not be room in parliament for an extended guest list, saying: 'We aren’t going to make people come just to leave them outside.' It . is believed the steps are being taken at the request of Prince . Felipe, who wants a smaller celebration than that of his father King . Juan Carlos, who was crowned four decades ago after the death of . dictator General Francisco Franco in 1975. It is the third time in as many days that the heir to the throne and his glamorous wife have been pictured at public events, showing they are ready for the coronation, which is due to take place next week . It seems the king-in-waiting has made the . request out of awareness of the economic crisis devastating the . country, as well as weekend . republican protests in several parts of the country. But despite the lack of ceremony around the occasion, it is expected that the new king and his wife Letizia will present themselves to the public from the balcony of the . official Royal Palace in Madrid after the event. King Juan Carlos and his wife Queen Sofia did the same after the coronation in 1975. It is thought the couple will then embark on a royal tour of foreign nations, beginning with Spain's neighbours Morocco, Portugal and France. When Juan Carlos was sworn in a king, pictured above, it was a much larger affair than what is expected from the imminent coronation of Crown Prince Felipe, pictured third from right as a young boy. The event included a mass after the coronation which is not expected to be held this time around . King Juan Carlos was crowned in 1975 after the death of General Francisco Franco, pictured left. After the coronation, he and Queen Sofia greeted Spaniards from the balcony of the Royal Palace in Madrid, right . But despite the planned low-key nature . of the event, the king-in-waiting and his wife have been putting in . several public appearances over the past few days to prove they are . ready for the statesmanship that awaits them. Princess . Letizia of Spain has oozed class at . three different events in as many days, including a visit to student . residences today in Madrid, Spain. The princess and her husband also joined . the royal family at a lavish gala dinner on Tuesday, as part of celebrations to . welcome the Mexican president, Enrique Pena Nieto, to Spain. After that, they 'dressed down' to receive members of the Patronage of the Prince of Asturias Foundation at the Royal Palace in Madrid. King Juan Carlos of Spain, who has been on the throne for nearly 40 years, announced last week that he was abdicating . She had . already spent the afternoon networking, at a reception hosted by King . Juan Carlos for the arriving president on the steps of the Zarzuela Palace, in Madrid. The events, although arranged to welcome the Mexican president to Spain, were a chance for Princess Letizia to publicly show her support for her husband. King Juan Carlos of Spain announced last week that he planned to end his four-decade reign in favour of his 46-year-old son. And earlier today, the Spanish Parliament voted overwhelmingly in favor of urgent government legislation allowing King Juan Carlos to abdicate and hand over his duties to Crown Prince Felipe. The shock decision to end his 39-year reign came days after it was . claimed Carlos told courtiers he decided to abdicate because he did not . want his son to ‘wither’ and ‘grow old waiting for the throne like . Prince Charles’. In a . televised address, the 76-year-old said he . wanted to herald in a ‘new era of hope’ and ensure a ‘younger . generation… with new energies’ could take over the helm. According . to reports in the Spanish press, the king told aides he felt the time . was right to pass the throne on while Prince Felipe was still a young . man. ‘I do not want my son to wither waiting like Prince Charles,’ he reportedly told Rafael Spottorno, chief of the royal household. Prince Felipe and his wife Princess Letizia were seen at a reception for the Mexican president as well as a royal gala dinner earlier this week as they prepare for their new roles as state heads of the country . The private secretary said the king – whose popularity has slumped in recent years following a series of scandals – had been considering abdicating since his 75th birthday in January last year. However, last week, a source at the royal palace in Madrid claimed King Juan Carlos was abdicating for political reasons. The monarch’s popularity has nosedived amid accusations of being out of touch as his country struggles with its worst economic crisis in memory. In 2012, he was widely criticised for going on a secret hunting trip to Botswana to shoot elephants. The lavish holiday contrasted with the news at home that one in four Spanish workers was jobless. Prince Charles has been waiting for 62 years and four months – longer  than any other heir apparent in British history – to take the throne. He became heir apparent at the age of three when his mother, then Princess Elizabeth, who is now 88, acceded  in 1952.","Crown Prince Felipe, 46, is due to be enthroned as King of Spain on June 19 .

"London (CNN) -- The parents of Pakistani teen activist Malala Yousafzai arrived Thursday in Britain to reunite with their daughter, who has become an international symbol of courage after being shot by the Taliban for demanding education for girls. The 15-year-old, who at times has been unconscious, is being treated in a Birmingham hospital for a gunshot wound to the head. Her father, Ziauddin Yousafzai, has been a central influence for Malala. He ran a school in Pakistan's conservative Swat Valley that kept its doors open to girls -- in defiance of the Taliban. Her parents' arrival on Thursday came 10 days after Malala was flown to Britain. Arrests made in shooting of Pakistani schoolgirl . Malala has been unable to speak because a tube has been inserted into her trachea to protect her airway, which was swollen after her injury. ""I am leaving this country with a heavy heart and in extraordinary circumstances because the whole country knows that it is essential that I be with my daughter during her recovery,"" her father told Pakistani network PTV before leaving Islamabad, in his first public remarks since the October 9 shooting. ""With the nation's prayers she survived the attack and she will surely recover and her health will progress. And, God willing, as soon as she is recovered, I will be back in Pakistan."" Khushal Khan, Malala's younger brother, called for the nation to rally behind his sister. ""I want to tell all my friends to pray for Malala,"" he said. Opinion: Why Malala should not be turned into modern Joan of Arc . Malala has been thinking about school even while she lies in her hospital bed, Interior Minister Rehman Malik told reporters after meeting with her family -- she asked her father to take her school books with him. ""The mission she has taken forward and the education awareness that has spread across Pakistan is all Malala's doing,"" he said, according to PTV. ""So I think that our entire nation should be proud of her love for the soil of her country."" After Malala recovers and returns to Pakistan, he said, ""we will provide her with complete security, despite anyone's refusal, to ensure that something like this never happens again. The attack on Malala was a mindset of people who don't want to see this country progress."" Pakistan President Asif Ali Zardari has spoken with the girl's father, asking him to stay in Britain as long as necessary while his daughter recovers, Rehman Malik said. Malala has been communicating with medical staff by writing notes, the hospital has said. What's your message for Malala? As of Thursday, Malala ""continued to respond well to treatment,"" the hospital's website said. She is expected to need ""a significant period of rest and recuperation"" before undergoing reconstructive surgery, Dr. Dave Rosser, medical director of University Hospitals Birmingham, said last week. That surgery could involve reinserting a piece of her own skull or fitting her with a titanium plate. Malala was fighting an infection, but was able to move her extremities and has stood with help from nurses, the hospital said. Although the bullet grazed her brain as it passed from above her eye into her shoulder, she understands where she is and seems to be functioning well intellectually, it added. Malala sent a message of thanks to the thousands of people in Pakistan and elsewhere who have attended rallies and vigils honoring her courage and praying for her recovery. The Taliban have claimed responsibility for the shooting, but don't appear to have anticipated the level of condemnation it would provoke. Malala initially gained international attention in 2009, as the Taliban gained a foothold in her home region of Swat, a Taliban redoubt in northwest Pakistan, near Afghanistan. Girl shot alongside Malala haunted by attack . On her blog, Malala wrote about her life in the region, a center of militant activity where girls schools were shuttered and strict Islamist rules imposed. In her writings, which earned her Pakistan's first National Peace Prize, she encouraged young people to oppose the Taliban. Pakistani police said Wednesday that six men have been arrested in Swat in connection with Malala's shooting, but the primary suspect remained at large. Police have identified Atta Ullah Khan, a 23-year-old man from the district where she was attacked, as the primary suspect. Police said they were searching for Khan, who was studying for a master's degree in chemistry. CNN's Jonathan Wald and Shaan Khan contributed to this report.","Plane carrying Malala's parents lands in Birmingham, England .

"The judge who allowed the naming of a teenager who killed his teacher yesterday hit back at his critics and insisted that public shaming had a ‘clear deterrent effect.’ Mr Justice Coulson took a swipe at ‘ill-informed commentators’ as he explained why he agreed to a media application to allow 16-year-old Will Cornick to be identified. The judge dismissed defence claims Cornick should be protected under European human rights laws. Jailed: Classroom murderer Will Cornick, 16, left, was allowed to be named after he was sentenced to a minimum of 20 years in jail for the murder of his teacher Ann Maguire, 61, right, in front of her class . Cornick was told he must serve a minimum of 20 years for murdering teacher Ann Maguire, 61, in front of her class and warned him he might never be released because he is so dangerous. During a discussion on the BBC’s Newsnight programme on Tuesday critics argued that Cornick’s name should have been kept secret because he will be put at risk and it will hinder his rehabilitation. They said no useful purpose was served by naming the killer – and said the killers of James Bulger, Robert Thompson and Jon Venables, also should not have been named. In his written judgement Mr Justice Coulson said he came down ‘firmly on the side of the public interest.’ 'Naming him has a clear deterrent effect': Mr Justice Coulson said identifying Cornick as the killer would also inform the public debate about the issues . He said: ‘In my view, naming him has a clear deterrent effect. Ill-informed commentators may scoff, but those of us involved in the criminal justice system know that deterrence will almost always be a factor in the naming of those involved in offences such as this.’ The judge added: ‘It has to be noted that this is an exceptional case. Public interest has been huge. There are wider issues at stake, such as the safety of teachers, the possibility of American-style security measures in schools, and the dangers of “internet loners” concocting violent fantasies on the internet. ‘I consider that the debate on those issues will be informed by the identification of William Cornick as the killer. ‘That is not least because he cannot be dismissed as the product of a hopeless background or a dysfunctional family. ‘On the contrary, for the reasons already given, he came from a loving and supportive family who have been devastated by what he did.’ David Glen, a barrister representing media organisations including the Daily Mail, had argued criminals who commit ‘serious and detestable’ offences should be publicly identified. Cornick’s barrister Richard Wright, QC, told Leeds Crown Court naming Cornick would be ‘wholly contrary’ to his welfare. Mr Wright said there was a real and immediate danger Cornick would either kill himself or be attacked by other inmates if his identity was known. He argued it would make any prospect of his rehabilitation ‘effectively impossible.’ Fears for the killer’s family was also given as a reason for secrecy, but the judge said Cornick’s supportive parents will continue to help their son ‘whether he is identified or not’ On Newsnight the decision was criticised by a convicted juvenile murderer. Ben Gunn, who served 32 years in prison for murdering a friend, said: ‘I don’t see how it’s of any use, it serves no useful purpose, to put his name and picture in the paper.’ Gunn was 14 when he pleaded guilty to clubbing an 11-year-old friend to death on a bus with the leg of a school desk. Author Blake Morrison, compared the case to that of James Bulger’s killers Robert Thompson and Jon Venables, about whom he has written extensively. He said: ‘By naming the boy he will be exposed to dangers from other prisoners and of course his family, who are blameless in this, will also be in the public eye. ‘So I honestly don’t see what public interest is being served here by people knowing who this boy is.’ Frances Crook, of the Howard League for Penal Reform wrote in the Guardian: ‘Any judge who claims that it is in the public interest to identify a 16-year-old boy convicted of murder – as happened today to the killer of schoolteacher Ann Maguire – risks giving in to the voracious media and to public voyeurism.’",Mr Justice Coulson takes a swipe at ‘ill-informed commentators’ He said there was 'huge' public interest in naming Ann Maguire's killer . Critics said he was giving into 'voyeurism' and putting Cornick at risk .,0e44631f50cbf122856ef0436e4fdacdff09837c

"NEW YORK (CNN) -- A Columbia University professor, who gained notoriety when a noose was found on the door of her office, has been fired after months of public and private allegations of plagiarism and racial targeting. Madonna Constantine, professor of psychology and education at the university's Teachers College, was initially suspended after an independent 18-month investigation into allegations of plagiarism concluded that on several occasions she had published academic work without crediting others for content. Constantine immediately denounced the findings as well as her suspension, calling the university's actions ""vindictive and mean-spirited."" ""It is my opinion that this investigation, along with other incidents that have happened to me at Teachers College in recent months, point to a conspiracy and witch-hunt by certain current and former members of the Teachers College community,"" she said in a written statement. Twenty-six pages of tables and spreadsheets submitted to CNN by Paul Giacomo, Constantine's attorney, contend that the passages in question can be traced to previous writings by Constantine. According to Giacomo, the former teacher at the school and two former students who alleged plagiarism had in fact plagiarized from Constantine. He called the termination of his client's employment an ""entirely retaliatory"" move intended to punish Constantine for filing a grievance against the university president and appealing the faculty's prior decision to suspend her. He called the university's treatment of his client unfair. ""To me, it was tantamount to a kangaroo court,"" Giacomo said of the review process. ""They wanted to be rid of her."" A spokesperson representing Teachers College disagreed. ""She was given a full and fair opportunity to respond to the allegations against her,"" Marcia Horowitz of Rubenstein public relations told CNN. ""She was provided with copies of the journal works where similarities were found and was given an opportunity to explain them. All appropriate legal processes were followed."" Giacomo said Constantine may challenge the university's actions in court. The NYPD would not comment on the progress of the investigation into the noose incident.

"When Kenny Lovelace took Molly Ryan to Coors Field to see the Colorado Rockies play the Arizona Diamondbacks last week, he had a diamond ring in his back pocket and a big plan. Lovelace had already informed Ryan's parents that he planned on asking Molly to be his wife and that he was going to project the romantic question on the stadium's jumbotron. Lovelace, the entire Ryan family, and secretly hired wedding photographer Kerinsa Mullins, made their way to the stadium for an unforgettable and comedic night. But their camera ready moment was ruined when a disgruntled old woman watching the game made her feelings known by flipping the bird to the camera.

The couple enjoyed a romantic evening despite being flipped off by the old lady in some of the photographs taken by Kerinsa Mullins: www.kerinsamarie.com . Molly Ryan knew that Lovelace was going to propose to her at some point but didn't know exactly when. According to coverage from WTOP, hours earlier at a taco bell, Molly picked up a hot sauce packet that read, 'will you marry me?' She reportedly threw the hot sauce packet at Lovelace and said, 'See? even Taco Bell thinks you should marry me.' When the family arrived at the game, everything was set for the jumbo plan. Kerinsa Mullins and her husband were standing a few rows away from the family ready to snap of photo of Lovelace and Ryan the moment he popped the question. Not Planned was the fact that the photographer was going to be seated near an older couple who wanted to watch the game and nothing but the game. As soon as the jumbotron flashed, 'Will you marry me, Molly?' the photographer stood up to take a photo of the proposal and the grouchy older couple yelled at her to sit down. Upon taking the photograph, Mullins explained to the elderly couple that she was only standing monetarily to photograph the proposal. Lovelace dropped to his knee. Molly Ryan said, 'Yes!' and the crowd cheered. 'He got down on one knee and that's when I realized it was me and I just started crying and it was a great moment,' Ryan says. Molly Ryan displays her new engagement ring after Kenny Lovelace proposed to her for the entire Colorado stadium to see . The older woman seated near Mullins was none too pleased. Another person who was with the older couple even called over a security guard because she couldn't return to her seat. Mullins received glares. 'They kept yelling at me and I just ignored them because I was there to do a job and I did not want to miss something that would be so brief and so important,' Mullins says. Once the security guard came over to Mullins, she moved out of the unhappy trio's way. It wasn't until the next day that Mullins found an unwanted surprise in an otherwise romantic photograph of Lovelace and Ryan. 'in about 20 of them, she and her friend are giving me the stink eye,' Mullins says. Molly Ryan's facebook page humorously displays Kerinsa Mullin's photo as her profile picture . In one of the photos the older woman is pictured flipping her middle finger at the camera. Mullins was worried the couple might be disappointed at first, but Ryan was extremely amused. 'I couldn't stop laughing. I said it was the greatest photo I've ever seen...There is a girl sitting behind us that is so excited for us. My mom is crying, I'm crying, and Ken's nervous and then there's this lady flipping us off,' says Ryan. Ryan Joked about making the photo a 'save the date' magnet for friends and family. While some friends were sad for Ryan that the old woman may have ruined her special moment, Ryan maintained her sense of humor and poise. Ryan is quoted as saying that is she finds out the identity of the curmudgeon she'd like to, 'make her famous.'She has even offered to invite the old lady to the wedding. 'I would love for her to appear in one of my pictures at the wedding. That would be terrific,' Ryan says. The photo of the woman flipping off her finger is now Molly Ryan's profile photo on facebook. The Old woman has yet to reveal her mysterious identity.","'Will you marry me, Molly?' read the stadium jumbotron .

"(CNN) -- President Barack Obama has expressed regret over a NATO air strike earlier in the week that resulted in the deaths of nine Afghan boys, according to a White House statement released Thursday. The president, during a video teleconference Wednesday with Afghan President Hamid Karzai, indicated his ""deep regret for the tragic accident in Kunar Province,"" the statement said.  Obama ""conveyed his condolences to the Afghan people and stressed that he and (top American commander Gen. David) Petraeus take such incidents very seriously."" Obama and Karzai ""agreed that such incidents undermine our shared efforts in fighting terrorism,"" the statement said. U.S. Lt. General David Rodriguez released a video statement earlier Thursday describing the incident.  Rodriguez said that on Tuesday, insurgents in mountains above a coalition base launched a rocket attack that wounded a U.S. civilian. Troops returned fire, and insurgents later shot another rocket at the troops. Two attack helicopters flew to the location where ""they were told the rockets came from,"" identified who they thought were insurgents and killed nine people. Later, they found that the slain people were boys cutting wood. Rodriguez called the incident ""a terrible mistake"" and promised disciplinary action if warranted. Civilian casualties during warfare in Afghanistan have hurt NATO's International Security Assistance Force.  The statements from top U.S. officials reflect the high priority coalition leaders place on avoiding such accidents. Rodriguez said such incidents are ""rare"" when considering all of the operations the coalition undertakes.  He said a lot of time is spent training soldiers on how to ""engage the right targets,"" and directives are constantly reviewed. ""We have done much better preventing civilian casualties,"" he said. ""But we acknowledge we have to do better."" Rodriguez said the military understands families' grief over such deaths, and he said soldiers ""feel worse than they can express"" when they ""do something terrible like mistakenly killing young boys."" ""They have to live with that for the rest of their lives,"" he said. Rodriguez also urged Afghans to help their security forces battle insurgents. His statement followed a public apology Wednesday from Petraeus. ""We are deeply sorry for this tragedy and apologize to the members of the Afghan government, the people of Afghanistan, and, most importantly, the surviving family members of those killed by our actions,"" Petraeus said. ""Regrettably, there appears to have been an error in the hand-off between identifying the location of the insurgents and the attack helicopters that carried out the subsequent operations."" Karzai condemned the incident ""in the strongest terms possible."" He noted the incident occurred less than 10 days after another incident ""that left many civilians dead in the same province."" On February 20, Kunar Gov. Sayed Fazlullah Wahidi said 64 civilians had died in a joint operation by ISAF and Afghan security forces over several days. The dead included 20 women and 15 children, he said. Petraeus recently directed military commanders in Afghanistan to review changes meant to minimize civilian casualties. He has ordered commanders to brief helicopter attack crews again on the changes, he said.",NEW: Obama expresses regret for the deaths of the Afghan boys .

"By . Associated Press . and Mail Online Reporter . Jason Brown, 24, is accused of dismembering several dogs and keeping their heads in a refrigerator while staying at a Nevada motel . A 24-year-old man is accused of killing and dismembering several dogs and keeping their heads in a small refrigerator while staying at a Nevada motel. Jason Brown is scheduled to appear at a status hearing Wednesday in Washoe District Court on animal torture and drug charges that could send him to prison for more than 20 years. Authorities say he was arrested July 9 after a maid called police when she found a decapitated dog in the bathtub of a room Brown was renting at the Super 8 Motel in Reno. Police say they found four dog heads inside a small refrigerator, and several bloody knives and scissors. Brown had reportedly been staying at the motel for a several days without letting cleaners into his room. His lawyer, John Oakes, tells the Reno Gazette-Journal the former Reno High . School student has 'mental health issues'. He says he may need a psychiatric evaluation before he goes to trial. It's believed Brown bought at least two of the dogs he killed off the listings website, Craigslist. The were reported to have been Chihuahuas. Kevin Schiller, Washoe County Regional Animal Services assistant manager and department head, said at the time of Brown's arrest: 'We haven't had any cases like this before. 'This is probably the second major case we've had dealing with animal abuse. 'They're not that common, at least at this level.' Police say they found four dog heads inside a small refrigerator, and several bloody implements inside Brown's room at the Super 8 Motel in Reno . Brown had reportedly been staying at the motel for a several days without letting cleaners into his room . If Brown had committed such acts before 2011 Reno police would have only been able to charge him with misdemeanors. However, the laws were changed after Raymond Rios adopted a dog from Craigslist and sliced the dog’s stomach open with a box cutter in a Reno motel leading to its death. This led to Cooney’s Law being passed, which allows police to charge people accused of animal cruelty with felony counts.","Jason Brown, 24, is accused of dismembering several dogs and keeping their heads in a refrigerator while staying at the Super 8 Motel in Nevada .

"Jayne Copley put on her old nurse uniform and pretended she was on duty to get hold of Tramadol . A former nurse wore her old uniform and carried her ID card to trick hospital staff into handing over strong painkiller Tramadol. Jayne Copley, 34, pretended to be on duty by putting on her old uniform at Hull Royal Infirmary and duped staff into giving her packets of the drug, claiming they were for patients. The mother-of-one brazenly walked into two hospital wards, asked for the narcotic-like drugs - which can be highly addictive - and explained they were for a patient in another ward. But another nurse on duty raised the alarm after she became suspicious and Copley, from Hull in East Yorkshire, was arrested the same day. She admitted two charges of fraud by false representation yesterday at Hull Magistrates' Court. Prosecutor James Byatt said there had been an element of 'pre-planning' by Copley before she went into Wards 4 and 40 on June 9, this year, to obtain the drugs. 'This lady used to be a nurse and she kept her nurse's uniform and identification badge,' he said. 'She was going into Hull Royal Infirmary to one ward saying, ""Can I have some Tramadol tablets"", claiming they were needed by staff for a patient in Ward 6. 'She wasn't working at the hospital and the ward didn't need the tablets - they were for her. 'She then went into another ward and did the same thing.' Copley, who has a two-year-old daughter, had told staff she was employed by private health service Bupa but was working at Hull Royal Infirmary as a temporary bank nurse - registered nurses who provide cover to NHS hospitals. When Copley was arrested she denied the offences and claimed staff had mistaken her for someone else. At an earlier hearing, Mr Byatt said: 'I understand Ms Copley is a registered nurse but at the time of these alleged offences she was not working for the NHS or a private company. 'She suggested to various people she was working for Bupa and had signed up on that day as a bank nurse on Ward 6. 'She went into two wards - Ward 4 and 40 - and requested from members of staff there, Tramadol, the painkilling drug. 'It was alleged the drugs were needed by staff for a patient on Ward 6. 'There was not a huge quantity of the drug and the staff say it was being used as a controlled drug to relax the patients.' Mr Byatt added that she had breached the trust of the other nurses when she made off with almost 70 tablets of the painkiller, which is used to treat moderate to severe pain. Copley walked into Hull Royal Infirmary (pictured) and asked staff on two wards for the powerful drugs, claiming they were for a patient in another ward. She pocketed the 70 pills for herself and was later arrested . She was caught when another nurse became wary and informed management, who investigated and called the police. In mitigation for Copley, Michael Miller described the case as 'unusual' but asked for it to be adjourned for pre-sentence reports. He said: 'It is clearly unusual circumstances and they don't fit neatly into the sentencing guidelines. 'She has no previous convictions and has a two-year-old daughter. 'Clearly there are issues as to the background of this. 'Obviously these drugs were for her own use. I ask for the preparation of a pre-sentence report.' Russell Moore, the head of security at Hull and East Yorkshire Hospitals NHS Trust, praised staff for raising the alarm quickly. He said: 'Fraud committed against the NHS takes vital funds away from our hospitals and the patients we serve. 'In this case, members of hospital staff acted quickly to raise their concerns and we would like to praise them for their part in bringing this case to court.' Copley pleaded guilty to both charges yesterday and will be sentenced on December 11. Chair of the bench Peter Robson told Copley: 'We are going to seek reports to be prepared. 'These will assist us in the sentencing and it is in your interest to co-operate.'","Jayne Copley, 34, pretended to be on duty at the Hull Royal Infirmary .

"British model Heather McCartney has revealed that she stripped off in a corporate box during the AFL Grand Final between Hawthorn and the Sydney Swans as part of a bet. The Scottish 26-year-old took off her clothes in front of thousands of Australian rules football fans at the Melbourne Cricket Ground on Saturday - with the subsequent pictures causing a storm on social media. After receiving complaints, police arrived to arrest her - but she lashed out, kicking, punching and biting the officers as they tried to handcuff her. Her team, Hawthorn, won back-to-back flags for the first time since 1988/89, with a 63-point win over Sydney. Scroll down for video . Tom Steinfort tweeted a photo of Heather McCartney, naked in a corporate box at the MCG, captioning the snap: 'Celebrating your team winning the grand final by getting nude in a corporate box... priceless' Heather McCartney (left) donning a Hawthorn scarf before she danced naked in full view (right) of strangers during the game's final quarter at AFL Grand Final . The Gold Coast woman spent the night in a police cell and was fined A$300 for indecent manner. McCartney spoke out after her court appearance on Sunday - and revealed she stripped off for a bet. 'It was a bet. I said if Hawthorn win, I’m getting naked. They won, and I got naked,' she told the Herald Sun. Ms McCartney said she stripped for a bet: 'What a f---ing day, it was great' 'What a f---ing day, it was great.' McCartney posted a raunchy photograph of herself, with her hair in pigtails, wearing just a yellow bikini top and dark bottoms and a red AFL ball in one hand on Monday morning. She captioned: 'What a weekend! Had a blast with my girl. Melbourne.' One man who claimed he was in the box during the stunt said McCartney was hired for the day and was promised double pay if she 'got naked and cheered in front of everyone'. Despite receiving messages of congratulations on Facebook, the incident has angered officials at the MCG,who have launched an investigation. MCC spokesman Shane Brown told the Herald Sun it would work with Victoria Police and the client to establish the circumstances, and appropriate action would be taken. 'From the evidence available, we are very disappointed ... and are taking the matter seriously,' he said. An AFL spokesman said they were also awaiting on information from the MCC regarding the investigating. AFL Fans Association spokesman Brian Clarke told the Herald Sun he was disgusted by the return of the 'blokey culture' to AFL. 'It’s a disgrace. It’s the people’s game and it’s for families,' he said. The model appeared at a Melbourne court after a night in police custody . 'This goes against everything the AFL has been trying to achieve. I hope the AFL come down hard on those who were behind this.' The model was forced to the ground and cuffed in an unknown state of undress. During her arrest, she reportedly yelled ‘f*** off, I don’t have to tell you anything, you f**ing r****d,’ before hitting an officer in the face, the Sun Herald also claims. Images of McCartney cavorting naked in the MCG corporate box have gone viral on social media, with disbelieving onlookers snapped in the background. She was released from Melbourne Remand Centre after a night in custody and appeared in the Melbourne Magistrates Court on Sunday. McCartney was seen leaving court on Sunday morning, holding a clear plastic bag of her belongings, including her clothes, shoes and make up. She was wearing black tights and a dark grey knitted jumper and had no shoes on at the time. The court was told that McCartney was dared to strip naked if Hawthorn won the Grand Final against Swans . McCartney has gained a significant number of followers on her official Facebook fan page 'Miss Lady Darling' after Saturday night's explicit stunt. One Facebook user named Kevin Richardson commented: 'How was your night in the slammer Heather??' Scott Evan said: 'Awesome show yesterday!' Michael Coyte said: 'well done darling' William Divic said: 'Damn didn't recognize you with clothes on' Heather McCartney, a 26-year-old Scottish model is currently living on the Gold Coast . The court was told that she accepted an invitation to attend the corporate box and dared to strip if Hawthorn won. The Hawks (21.11.137) easily claimed the cup over the Sydney Swans (11.8.74). However, there are claims that Ms McCartney was hired to strip, according to Herald Sun. McCartney's lawyer told the court 'she didn’t understand at the time it could lead to police involvement'. The court also heard that alcohol and strong medication for aplastic anaemia had made her unable to control her actions. Magistrate Alan Spillane described her conduct as 'pretty nasty offending.' 'The part I think is really worrying is basically you were biting and hitting out at people who were out trying to do their job.' At 6.15pm police received reports of a naked woman in a corporate box. McCartney pleaded guilty to several charges including an act in an indecent manner. Like MailOnline Sport's Facebook page.

Since the Arab unrest began earlier this year, thousands of people from Libya and other parts of North Africa have sought refuge there. Contrary to its name, Rabbit Island is probably more renowned for turtles. It is one of the last remaining egg-laying sites in Italy for the endangered loggerhead sea turtle. Nobody answered Rabbit Island in our photo challenge this week, but there were some close guesses of Sardinia, Italy, as well as some generic guesses of the Mediterranean.

"(CNN) -- An armed airman who allegedly barricaded himself inside a building on a Colorado air base is awaiting sentencing on unrelated charges and will likely face additional charges, the base said Tuesday. Airman 1st Class Nico Cruz Santos, 21, surrendered to authorities late Monday night after an hours-long standoff with authorities at Schriever Air Force Base. No one was injured. ""While there are lessons to be learned from every situation, by and large yesterday's incident was resolved with the best possible outcome,"" said Col. James Ross, 50th Space Wing commander, in a Tuesday statement. ""Our law enforcement and community partners worked together to ensure the security of our mission and people while helping this airman through a troubling situation."" The airman -- who belongs to the base's 50th Security Forces Squadron -- locked himself around 10 a.m. inside a building where personnel get paperwork and equipment before being deployed, said Lt. Marie Denson, a spokeswoman at the Colorado Springs base. Soon thereafter, that building and the surrounding area was evacuated. Law enforcement units and other first responders from the Schriever base, nearby Peterson Air Force Base and the El Paso County, Colorado, Sheriff's Office SWAT team rushed to the scene, Lt. Col. Harold Hoang said. The man was armed with a personal handgun, authorities said. He also had his cell phone, which he had been using -- along with a land-line phone -- to communicate with military officials outside. Mental health professionals were also on site, Denson said. The airman ""is currently facing legal action in a civilian court as well as disciplinary action and possible discharge from the Air Force,"" Hoang said. The base said in a statement Tuesday that Santos is awaiting sentencing in Gilpin County on unrelated charges earlier this year. ""It is expected that once the investigation of yesterday's incident is complete that additional charges may be filed in either the military or civilian court systems,"" the statement said. The incident remained under investigation Tuesday. Santos was being held in a Teller County detention facility, the base said. Schriever Air Force Base is also home to the Space Innovation and Development Center, the Missile Defense Agency, 310th Space Wing and other units and groups, according to its website.

"(CNN) -- Firefighters near Yosemite National Park made gains Saturday afternoon on a wildfire that torched 300 acres, injured one person and forced the evacuation of some nearby homes. More than 745 fire personnel contained 60% of the wildfire, which ignited Friday, the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection said. The Mariposa County Sheriff's Office evacuated an undisclosed number of residents in the Ponderosa Basin area, and authorities said 700 structures were threatened. Jamie Williams in the Cal Fire call center said Saturday night that almost all of the residents in the Ponderosa area have been allowed to return home. Janet Smith evacuated her house and moved her two dogs and cat to a parking lot in Mariposa. ""I just bought this house a year ago so I'd hate to lose it,"" she said.

"Two brothers have been reunited through Facebook after losing touch and spending quarter of a century living on opposite sides of the world. David Horner, 53, and his younger brother Stuart, 49, lost contact with each other after their father's funeral in 1989, following which Stuart travelled with the RAF before settling in New Zealand. David, from Sheffield, south Yorkshire, moved house, and despite both of them trying to contact the other, they failed to do so until earlier this year, when they finally met after finding each other through Facebook. David Horner, 53, left, and his brother Stuart, 49, were reunited after losing touch for quarter of a century . The boys lost touch after their father's funeral in 1989, when Stuart Horner joined the RAF and went abroad . David, a retired chef, said: 'He looks totally different.  I don't know if I'd recognise him passing in the street.' His younger brother, who lives in New Zealand and no longer works for the RAF, explained how they lost touch. 'Our dad was our point of contact, so after he died we lost that,' Stuart said.  'I struggled to grieve after losing my dad, and threw myself into work. 'I travelled around a lot, so I was not easy to track down, and David had also moved.' While Stuart sought to lose himself as he struggled with his grief, his older brother never forgot him, and each year bought a birthday card for Stuart that he wrote but could not post. He said: 'All these years I never forgot his birthday.  I bought him a card every year and used to write him emotional messages. 'It helped when I was ill and had two strokes - it gave me someone to turn to.' Every year, David Horner bought his 'baby brother' a birthday card, which he wrote and stored away for him . When the brothers eventually spoke over the phone, David said: 'There weren't many words - we just sobbed' 'Found out I have cancer again': David's 2005 card tells of his health battles, adding: 'Wish you were here xx' But despite his faith that one day he would see his younger brother again, he had moments of doubt. 'In 2012 I began to lose faith and wrote in his birthday card ""I doubt we'll see each other again"",' he said. But the following year after doing some research on the internet he found his niece, Stuart's daughter Tiffany, now 21, on Facebook. David said: 'I contacted her to see if he was her father and incredibly she said Yes.  I couldn't believe it. But the happy ending was postponed when either Tiffany or Stuart wrote down David's email address wrong. 'Unbeknownst to me, Stuart wrote me this long emotional email but it didn't get to me,' David said. 'That year I wrote in his card ""I guess this is goodbye - I tried to get in touch but I haven't heard anything, so I suppose you're not interested.""' Eventually, however, he made contact with Tiffany again, giving her his telephone number, and this time she put the two brothers in touch. Last year's card tells of David's despair as he signs of saying 'Thought I had found you but maybe not xx' So close: David said he wished his brother had been around to talk to as he battled with health problems . This year's card bears the message 'Wish I could have time with you' - and David's wish was finally granted . 'Stuart called me - I honestly couldn't believe it,' David said.  'When he rang there weren't many words exchanged - we just cried. 'I thought I was dreaming and when someone pinched me I'd wake up.' After they spoke, Stuart and his partner Lara Franklin, 41, flew 11,000 miles from their home in Wellington to Britain to visit David, who hadn't been well at his home in Sheffield. David, who suffered two strokes and was hospitalised four years ago for a lung condition, said he felt lucky he survived his illnesses to see his brother and sobbed as his sibling's car pulled up outside his house. He said: 'I was scared we wouldn't ever see each other again, but I never gave up hope. We're definitely not losing touch again.' Finally, he presented his younger brother with the 25 birthday cards he hadn't been able to send him. 'Sitting down to read the birthday cards together made us both very emotional,' David said. 'I never really got over my dad's death and I clung to the hope I would see Stuart again - which is shown in the messages I wrote to him. 'Some years I would write about what I'd been through, and others I would just sign off 'Love, your brother'. 'Stuart has quite a stiff upper lip through years of working with the RAF, but he got very upset reading them.'","David Horner, 53, and his brother Stuart, 49, last saw each other in 1989 .

"(CNN) -- Former Philippine President Corazon Aquino, whose ""People Power"" movement pushed out longtime strongman Ferdinand Marcos less than three years after her husband's assassination, has died at age 76, her family announced Saturday. ""She was the agent of change in Philippine democracy,"" said Ray Donato, the nation's consul-general in Atlanta. Aquino, the first woman to lead the Philippines, had been battling colon cancer since March 2008 and died of cardio-respiratory arrest at 3:18 a.m. Saturday (3:18 p.m. Friday ET), said Mai Mislang, a spokeswoman for her son, Philippine Sen. Benigno Aquino III. Funeral arrangements were being set up, Mislang said.  Philippine President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo has also announced a 10-day mourning period for the former president, said Ray Donato, the country's consul-general in Atlanta. ""She was the agent of change in Philippine democracy, and almost all the Filipinos I know revered her during her presidency,"" Donato said. Aquino had been born into a wealthy family and was educated in the United States. She had not been involved in politics before her husband, opposition leader Benigno ""Ninoy"" Aquino Jr., was gunned down at Manila's airport in August 1983 as he returned from exile. The political novice took over the leadership of her husband's movement after his death and challenged Marcos in a 1986 election, making a yellow dress her trademark and bolstered by the support of the country's Roman Catholic churches. Marcos had been backed by the United States, the former colonial power in the Philippines, for two decades as a stalwart anti-communist. He and his wife Imelda were friends of then-President Ronald Reagan and his wife, Nancy. But widespread allegations of electoral fraud and a mutiny by the country's military led the Reagan administration to withdraw its support, and Marcos went into exile in Hawaii. Aquino took office in a country with a $28 billion debt, widespread poverty and a persistent Marxist insurgency. She put in place a U.S.-style constitution that limited presidents to a single six-year term and survived seven coup attempts -- including one that was supressed with American help. She also oversaw the closure of the major U.S. military bases in the country before leaving office in 1992. The bases had been a bulwark of American power in the Pacific since the early 1900s and employed nearly 80,000 Filipinos, but Aquino's opponents argued the country was too dependent on the United States. Aquino announced in 1990 that it was time to begin negotiating the ""orderly withdrawal"" of U.S. forces.","NEW: Funeral arrangements are being set up, spokeswoman says .

"My aim heading to Germany was firstly to extend my lead in the championship over Lewis Hamilton, and then win what is my second home race after Monaco, so it was very special to win for myself and for Mercedes as it is one of the most important grands prix on the calendar for the team. Almost the entire Mercedes-Benz board was there, and after all the difficult times we went through as Mercedes in the first couple of years of the team, it was important to send out a good message. It was a picture perfect weekend for me, but not for the whole team given the problems we suffered on the other car. But for me I had no such worries, securing pole position and then winning the race. Good to be home: Nico Rosberg celebrates winning the German Grand Prix . Winner: Rosberg (second right) celebrates on the podium with Valtteri Bottas (left), Lewis Hamilton . VIDEO Rosberg uses local knowledge to triumph . It was really very emotional and it was great with all the support from the home fans. It was also nice that World Cup winner and Arsenal striker Lukas Podolski came to watch the race with our CEO Dr. Zetsche in the garage and to support me just as I had cheered him on him when he was representing Germany in Brazil, so that was really very cool. Given Lewis's brake failure in qualifying and subsequent crash, I knew it would be an easier race, but I didn't prepare any differently. I would have got more pleasure out of the victory if it would have been a gloves-off battle with my team-mate, but of course it was a very special win nevertheless, so heading into this weekend's race in Hungary I am very happy. After the win in Hockenheim, I celebrated with the team afterwards, and there was some really hilarious stuff going on. We were dancing together in the garage so that was a lot of fun, but with back-to-back races, there hasn't been a lot of time to take in the victory. As we headed away from the circuit in our car some fans pulled alongside us on the motorway, and they were going crazy. They slid open their van door and started singing 'this is a winner, this is a winner.' We took a video of their chanting, and its awesome to see how much fun they get out of me winning, being a German driver in a German car in Germany. A lot of people were really excited about it so it was great to witness that enthusiasm first hand. Unfortunately . the number of fans who attended the German Grand Prix was down on . recent years, and my impression was that people's racing enthusiasm has . decreased because of what has happened to Michael Schumacher. Hockenheim . was a place where Michael had so much success and I think all the . spectators have been hit by what has happened to him, and the condition . he is now in. I think that has maybe taken some excitement away from . racing. Obviously, we all still hope Michael makes as good a recovery as . he can. Ahead of the race there was lot of drama over the crash helmet we designed to celebrate Germany winning the World Cup. I had planned to put the World Cup trophy on the top of my lid, but I got a call from football's governing body FIFA to say that it was not allowed and that I must remove it because it is a trademark. Change: Nico Rosberg wasn't allowed to carry an image of the World Cup on his helmet for the race . Losing ground: Hamilton is now 14 points behind his Mercedes team-mate in the standings . Trouble behind: Rosberg leads the way as Massa crashes at the first corner . That was bit of a weird one. I removed it however, and everything was OK but it is incredible all the things that you have to think of. We never even took that into consideration when we designed the helmet! We quickly changed the concept and replaced the trophy with four stars to represent each of Germany's World Cup successes. This weekend I am deciding which helmet to run - whether it is the one I wore to victory in Germany or my usual one - so, I have asked the fans on Facebook to vote. Let me know what one you think I should wear at the Hungaroring. I go into this weekend's race very confident because I have a great car. I know that every track we go to, if I deliver I have the chance of being on pole and winning the race, and it does not get any better than that. These are exciting times, ones that I can share with the team, and are well deserved. We went through some tough periods, but now we are getting the success we deserve which is nice to see. I look forward to the remainder of the season. Toto Wolff made some comments earlier this week that it would be unfair if the championship was won at the last race as a result of the new double points system. The concept is really artificial, I don't like it and that is a pity, but that is the way it is and we have got to accept it. Winning is winning, and obviously I will be happy if I win this year's championship whatever the circumstances. Support: Toto Wolff's wife offered her sympathy to her injured husband on Twitter . Ahead: Rosberg dominated the race in Hockenheim, leaving rivals to battle for second and third . Accident: Mercedes GP Executive Director Toto Wolff (right) was involved in a cycling shunt . Talking of Toto, he will be in the garage this weekend despite what happened earlier this week. He and a number of the team were involved in a cycling shunt on the River Danube during a team building event. I did not take part, so I wasn't there, and I only joined up with the team for the dinner afterwards but it was a pretty big incident and a few guys were hurt. Toto suffered broken bones but, by the time I had arrived for dinner in the evening, there was already a lot of banter flying about, jokes were being made about the crash, and a lot of people were laughing about it, so that was nice to see as it shows how tight we are as a team. After this race, we head into the summer break; a four-week period before the next grand prix at the end of August in Belgium, which I will spend with friends, family and I plan to go to Ibiza. But before that, on Thursday night, I hosted a team BBQ where I invited all my mechanics out here in Hungary. They work their butt off for me so it is really important to spend some private time together. Happy: The German Grand Prix winner hosted a BBQ with his friends and mechanics in Hungary . Nico Rosberg's fee for his column will be donated to the Grand Prix Mechanics’ Charitable Trust, which is dedicated to providing help to former and current Formula One mechanics and their families, putting F1 mechanics throughout the world in touch with each other and raising funds to help in times of need.

"Controversial: Malawi President Bingu wa Mutharika had won power in the African state in 2004, but was unpopular among his countrymen . Bingu wa Mutharika, the controversial president of Malawi who saw the country fall into economic crisis, has died from a heart attack, it was reported today. The 78-year-old leader, reviled by many in his own country and the international community, was rushed to hospital after collapsing on Thursday, but could not be saved. Malawi state media said Mutharika had been flown out to South Africa for treatment, although the current whereabouts of his body remains unclear, according to Reuters. Medical sources told news agency the leader was flown from Lilongwe hospital because the power and energy crisis in Malawi is so severe the hospital could not carry out a proper autopsy or even keep his body refrigerated. Mutharika had become widely disliked by Malawians since becoming leader seven years ago, as many blamed him personally for the nation's crippling economic woes. As rumours of the death of the self-styled 'Economist in Chief' swept the capital on Thursday night, there were even pockets of drunken jubilation among locals who saw him turning back the clock on 18 years of democracy in the 'Warm Heart of Africa'. The country of 13 million had suffered chronic fuel shortages in recent months which led in turn to pump prices soaring by 30 per cent. The African country also teetered on the brink of civil unrest following various protests outside government buildings last year. Campaign: Mutharika, pictured in 2009, became involved in a diplomatic spat with Britain last year after David Cameron said he would cut aid to countries which do not support gay rights . The controversial statesman was condemned by the international community in July when more than a dozen people died after he deployed the army to crush protests against his government. At the end of last year Mutharika had to call an impromptu telephone press conference to confirm he was still alive, amid rumours he had died when he vanished from view. In November last year, Mutharika disappeared from Malawi during its economic crisis in order to take a holiday in Hong Kong. Rumours of his death came just three months after Mutharika sacked his entire cabinet, assuming every position himself. New wife: President Mutharika at his wedding to Callista Chapola-Chimombo in April last year . The statesman appointed new people to most of the roles, including several members of his own family. Britain had endured strained relations with Malawi and Mutharika, as the tyrant had lashed out against the UK amid speculation it was to cut its aid to developing countries who failed to protect gay rights. In Malawi, homosexuality is illegal and punishable by prison. The late president's brother and Malawi's foreign minister, Aurther-Peter Mutharika, is the heir apparent to the position and could be set to take over.",Controversial leader collapsed on Thursday but could not be saved .

"(CNN) -- The United Nations' Human Rights Council concluded Wednesday that Israeli forces committed serious violations of international law when they conducted a mid-sea interception of a humanitarian aid flotilla in an incident that left nine people dead. ""The fact-finding mission concluded that a series of violations of international law, including international humanitarian and human rights law, were committed by the Israeli forces,"" said the 56-page report. The report described the circumstances of the deaths of ""at least six of the passengers"" as being ""consistent with ... an arbitrary and summary execution."" Israel has maintained its troops used force on the activists in May after they were attacked by those on board one boat. Soldiers were attacked with knives, metal poles and other objects, Israeli officials have said. But passengers on board the boat insist Israeli troops fired on them without provocation. ""The report published today is as biased and as one-sided as the body that has produced it,"" the Israeli government said. ""Israel, therefore, is of the opinion that the flotilla incident is amply and sufficiently investigated as it is. All additional dealing with this issue is superfluous and unproductive."" But Israel on Wednesday said it was conducting its own investigation and will participate in a panel of inquiry called by U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon. The Human Rights Council, which indicated it spoke with more than 100 witnesses, said Israeli troops ""demonstrated levels of totally unnecessary and incredible violence"" against flotilla passengers during the May 31 interception. It said there was also evidence of wilful killing, torture or inhuman treatment and injury that would warrant prosecution within the Fourth Geneva Convention. ""The Mission is satisfied not only that the flotilla presented no imminent threat but that the interception was motivated by concerns about the possible propaganda victory that might be claimed by the organizers of the flotilla,"" the council's fact-finding mission declared. After Israeli forces landed on one vessel, a struggle for control of the ship began. Israeli forces fired at wounded people and killed several people who posed no threat, the report said. ""The circumstances of the killing of at least six of the passengers were in a manner consistent with an extra-legal, arbitrary and summary execution,"" it added. Israeli Defense Minister Ehud Barak has said that Israel went to great diplomatic lengths to stop the flotilla heading to the Palestinian territory of Gaza, and when that didn't work, it considered the implications of the use of force and weighed the possibility of simply letting the flotilla through. In the end, Israel made the right decision, Barak said recently in testimony before an Israeli commission looking into the incident. The incident left a wide-ranging military and diplomatic alliance between the Jewish state and Turkey, its powerful regional ally, badly shaken. The flotilla departed from Turkey.","Nine people were killed during interception of flotilla bound for Gaza . A U.N. probe says Israeli forces used unnecessary violence .

"Starbucks has announced that it will offer a delivery option on its mobile app in select areas of the U.S starting next year. The Seattle-based company declined to provide more details, but has been pushing to get people to use its app as a way to build customer loyalty. It also previously said it plans to let customers across the country place orders ahead of time on their smartphone by next year, an option intended to get people in and out of stores quicker.

An even easier caffeine fix: Starbucks has announced that it will offer a delivery option on its mobile app in select areas of the U.S starting next year . The delivery plans for the second half of 2015 were announced by Schultz during a conference call Thursday discussing the company's fiscal fourth quarter results. For the period ended September 28, Starbucks reported sales that rose but fell short of Wall Street expectations. Global sales at established locations rose 5per cent, including in the Americas and Asia. Starbucks Corp. is pushing aggressively into different areas as it faces more competition from fast-food chains serving specialty coffees. To boost sales of food in the afternoon, for instance, it has been revamping its sandwiches and adding new offerings like a grilled cheese sandwich that's warmed up in an oven. This summer, Starbucks also launched its Fizzio soda drinks in the Sunbelt. But Wells Fargo analysts said in a note this week that their checks at a dozen stores in six states suggested the drinks aren't performing up to expectations so far. In a phone interview, Chief Operating Officer Troy Alstead said the soda drinks are doing 'exactly what we expected it to do,' but that a national launch isn't planned for 2015. In a previous interview, Alstead had said he expected the drinks to be in much of the U.S. by the upcoming summer. Playing offense: Starbucks Corp. is pushing aggressively into different areas as it faces more competition from fast-food chains serving specialty coffees . Alstead said Starbucks is instead focusing on growing its tea business. He said tea accounted for a 'high single digit' percentage of sales last year, and that the company expects it to reach 'well into the teens' over time. For the quarter, Starbucks earned $587.9 million, or 77 cents per share. Not including one-time item, it earned 74 cents per share, which was in line with Wall Street expectations, according to FactSet. Revenue came in at $4.18 billion, short of the $4.24 billion analysts expected. For the current quarter ending in December, Starbucks expects its per-share earnings to range from 79 cents to 81 cents. Analysts expected 83 cents per share.

"The recipe for success belongs to Beth Royals of Richmond, Virginia, who won this year's 47th Pillsbury Bake-Off Contest and a $1 million payday with her Peanutty Pie Crust Clusters on Wednesday. Four finalists competed for the grand prize, which was announced during ABC's cooking-themed daytime series ""The Chew."" Each year, amateur home bakers and cooks flock to the contest for the prize money and to show off their skills in the kitchen. ""It's inspiring to see the creativity and originality from home cooks across the country,"" said Lynn Blanchard, the contest's head judge and Better Homes and Gardens test kitchen director. ""We were truly impressed by the caliber of each dish submitted. Each category finalist showed how creative, simple and delicious home cooking can be."" In November, 100 competitors won a trip to Nashville to participate in the Bake-Off in four recipe categories: Simply Sweet Treats, Savory Snacks and Sides, Amazing Doable Dinners and Weekend Breakfast Wows. The dishes were judged equally on taste, appearance, creativity and consumer appeal by a panel of food professionals, including ""The Chew"" co-host Carla Hall. The winners in each category were Courtney Sawyer of Bellingham, Washington, with Cuban-Style Sandwich Pockets for Doable Dinners;  Jody Walker of Madison, Mississippi, with Creamy Corn-Filled Sweet Peppers for Snacks and Sides;  Royals' Peanutty Pie Crust Clusters for Simply Sweet Treats; and Megan Beimer of Alexandria, Virginia, with Chocolate Doughnut Poppers for Breakfast Wows.

"(CNN) -- At age of 52, it might be too late to re-visit your beliefs and principles in order to change them. When you see the regression from where we were, to the situation now and realize the dream you have been working towards has moved almost entirely out-of-reach, you feel tired, hopeless, and less motivated to recharge yourself. I was born in Gaza in 1962 to a refugee family who had been expelled from their village ""Sawafir"" in the then British --mandate of Palestine. Five years later, in June 1967, Gaza was occupied by Israel, which meant that I grew up under the occupation. When you live under occupation, your national ambitions become clearer and stronger. I promised myself that I would do my utmost to contribute to achieving peace and freedom for our people and region through talks and debates. In 1987, at the age of 27, I took part in the first intifada, which I viewed as largely peaceful, with boys and girls throwing stones at well-equipped Israeli soldiers. Through that struggle, we succeeding in winning the hearts and minds, not only of the international community but also many Israelis themselves; who became advocates for our right to have a free and independent Palestinian state. I learned, to some extent, what freedom meant when I took my first plane trip, flying to London via Tel Aviv in 1993. I had been invited by Amnesty International in my capacity as the founder of the organization's Palestinian branch. I wrote articles and appeared on television and radio to promote human rights and non-violent struggle; I was invited to address Israeli audiences and receive Israeli citizens in Gaza itself. I also stood as a candidate in the first Palestinian parliamentary elections in 1996. Then, my dream of being a free citizen in a free state grew and flourished, but over time it gradually became weaker and weaker. Twenty years ago, how to make peace with Israel was a daily topic for the Palestinian people. It was very normal to see tens of Israelis citizens walking freely along Gaza streets, shopping and making conversation. On the other side of the border, an influential Israeli camp was advocating making peace with the Palestinians. Nowadays, ""peace"" is perhaps the least used word in Gaza's daily lexicon, replaced as it has been by the terms; tanks, F16, killing, shelling, rockets and revenge. And in Israel, politicians and groups compete to see who will be more aggressive towards the Palestinians. This is demonstrated by the success of the extreme right in politics. Twenty years ago, more than 80,000 Palestinian workers went to Israel every day to work alongside Israelis, acting as ambassadors for co-existance. Twenty years ago, it was common to see the slogan and fliers ""PEACE NOW"" on cars and at shops and restaurants. Making peace with the Palestinians appeared to be a priority for the Israeli public. Recently, the Israeli government built a huge wall separating Israel from the Palestinian territories. Now that Israeli citizens cannot see us any more, it seems they have lost sight of our reality. And the reality has been deteriorating. When the Israelis began building separation walls in the late 1990s, many of its citizens were being killed by suicide bombers. In September 2000, the second intifada erupted with a far more violent face than its predecessor. Hamas won the election in 2006 and took control from Fatah forcibly in June 2007, prompting Israel to blockade the Gaza Strip, which created humanitarians crises. Since then Israel has declared three wars against Gaza, in 2008, 2012 and now 2014. Meantime, Hamas and other resistance movements continue to launch homemade rockets into Israel's cities. Within the new reality, the Israelis and Palestinians are unable to see/meet/talk/interact with each other. I always say, it is easy to fight someone you don't know and/or have no mutual interests with, but you cannot make peace with someone unless you know them well and share interests. This is why it has been easy for the new generations on both sides -- Israeli and Palestinians -- to fight each other aggressively. They have never met and they don't see the benefit of living peacefully. Nowadays, they communicate from a distance through rockets, bullets, shelling, guns -- instead of physically interacting. The generations of both sides have been taken hostages by the conflict, they consume and waste their energy and resources to make the other's life more difficult. Both generations have to work harder to find the lost opportunity, which is hidden underneath scene of the conflict; they have to be educated to look differently. Regional cooperation . In today's globalized world, the problems have become cross-border despite being perceived as local. Regional cooperation is needed. Both Israelis and Palestinians suffer severe water shortages, pollution, population growth, radicalism, unemployment. But while the cost of conflict to both is huge, the profit of peace would be much higher. In addition to the waste of their own resources, the Palestinians have received billions of dollars of aid in the past 20 years since the Oslo accord, while Israel receives U.S. aid assistance of about US$3 billion every year. Some of the international aid and the local resources are spent in fueling the conflict, though it would make a huge and positive difference to people's lives if such huge amounts were instead used in developmental projects. Both the Israeli and Palestinian governments might be able to reach a peace agreement, but achieving culture of peace remains distant. I have never thought to leave Gaza or to emigrate, though I have always easy access to such a possibility. I believe that Gaza is in need of an ""agent of change."" I have been and I wanted to continue to be such an agent of change. But I feel tired, hopeless and less motivated to recharge myself. What is Israel's endgame in Gaza? What is Hamas' endgame in Gaza? How do we get a cease-fire to end the bloodshed in Gaza?","Omar Shaban was born to a Palestinian refugee family and grew up in Gaza .

"By . Mail Foreign Service . PUBLISHED: . 15:50 EST, 16 January 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 15:56 EST, 16 January 2013 . A convicted rapist is thought to have murdered a British student 23 years ago, a court has been told. Thierry Villetard has been named in French court documents as a suspect for the killing of 20-year-old Joanna Parrish, although he has not yet been placed under formal investigation. The 46-year-old lorry driver comes from the French town of Auxerre, where languages student Miss Parrish was working as an English teacher when she died in May 1990. Unsolved: Twenty three years after Miss Parrish's death, convicted rapist Thierry Villetard has been named in French court documents as a suspect, although he has not yet been placed under formal investigation . An angler found her naked body floating in a river a few miles from Auxerre. She had been raped and strangled. The murder investigation was reopened last year after witnesses – including a former girlfriend of Villetard from 1990 – came forward with what was described as ‘compelling evidence’. The girlfriend claimed Villetard returned home one evening in May 1990 with scratches on his arms and a denim bag similar to the one Miss Parrish was carrying on the evening she disappeared. Other witnesses have told police in Auxerre, which is in Burgundy between Paris and Lyon, that he boasted of killing two women. He is said to have dumped one of the bodies in a river near Auxerre and the other at a motorway rest area. Victim: Joanna Parrish was 20-years-old when she was murdered in 1990 while working as an English teacher in the French town of Auxerre . Villetard, who is described as a ‘habitual sexual attacker’ and is serving an eight-year sentence for rape, is now on trial in Montpellier in southern France accused of  raping the 15-year-old daughter of another girlfriend. In court yesterday he said he ‘remembered nothing’ about the alleged sex attack on the teenager. A prosecutor asked the judge to impose a 17-year-jail sentence on him. The court has been told that Villetard is also suspected of killing Miss Parrish in 1990 and another woman whose body was found beside a motorway in Provence in southern France in 1997. It is understood that a judge in . Paris heading the cold case investigation into Miss Parrish’s murder . will interview Villetard once the trial in Montpellier is concluded. The . Leeds University student, who came from Newnham on Severn in . Gloucestershire, had arranged to meet a man who had answered her advert . for English lessons. She was engaged and was hoping to . make some money for her wedding. Her body was found the next day. Miss . Parrish’s parents, Roger and Pauline, have never given up the struggle . to bring their daughter’s killer to justice. They have long been . critical of the French investigation. Journalists . and police were allowed to contaminate the crime scene so detectives . were left with few clues. Vital DNA evidence was lost, files went . missing and leads were not followed up properly. Until now the main suspect has been French serial killer Michel Fourniret, but he has never been tried. Fourniret . was nicknamed ‘the Beast of the Ardennes’ after he lured seven girls, . aged 12 to 21, to remote spots before strangling, shooting or stabbing . them.  He was jailed for life in 2008 for their murder. His wife, . Monique Olivier, is also in prison for life for complicity. Fourniret . was placed under investigation for Miss Parrish’s murder after his wife . told police that he had killed an English girl while he was living near . Auxerre. It later emerged that Olivier’s statement had been made under duress, with a prosecutor slapping her during an interrogation.

"London (CNN) -- Janet Jackson is opening up for the first time about a duet with her brother that she's reviving two years after his death. Jackson took to the stage in London on Thursday and performed their 1995 song Scream as video of Michael Jackson played and his voice filled Royal Albert Hall. The reworked duet follows in the footsteps of jazz pianist and singer Nat King Cole and his daughter, Natalie Cole. In 1991 she turned her father's famous 1961 recording ""Unforgettable"" into a father-daughter duet. Janet Jackson said she did the original duet at the request of her brother years ago. ""I was on the Rhythm Nation tour and Mike actually asked me to do a song with him and I told him no. I didn't want to do it. I felt I hadn't come into my own and I hadn't fully made a name for myself ... and I didn't want to ride anyone's coattails,"" she said. ""And I remember being in the Janet Tour a few good years later and he asked me again if I would do a song with him. And I felt, at that point, I'd carved my own little niche in this world of music and I felt okay, I can do this now and that's how it came about."" Jackson said that performing the song alongside her brother again isn't difficult. ""It feels great -- just listening to and hearing his voice,"" she said, adding that on stage she finds herself, ""remembering the experience of recording it."" Jackson declined to comment to the press on the two-year mark of her brother's death, instead taking to social media this week with a simple message on Twitter on the June 25 anniversary: ""I miss you, I love you."" Jackson wraps up the European leg of her tour this week then heads to North America, Australia and Africa.","Jackson performs virtual duet on stage in London .

"French extreme right-wing leader Marine Le Pen faces potential prosecution for branding Muslims in France as 'like a Nazi occupation'. The National Front chief risks being put on trial after members of the European Parliament's judicial committee in Brussels voted to lift her legal immunity as an MEP. Ms Le Pen sparked uproar among in France after a speech at a party rally in December 2012 when she denounced Muslims praying in the street in areas where there are no mosques. Stripped of legal immunity: French National Front leader Marine Le Pen could now face trial for inciting racial hatred after comparing the country's Muslim community to the Nazi occupation . France has a population of around five million Muslims, the highest of any European country. Le Pen told supporters: 'For those who like to talk about World War II, to talk about occupation, we could talk about, for once, the occupation of our territory. 'There are no armoured vehicles, no soldiers, but it is an occupation all the same and it weighs on people.' French prosecutors asked the EU last November to lift the her immunity as a lawmaker so she could be prosecuted for inciting racial hatred. The European Parliament's legal committee voted overwhelmingly yesterday that Le Pen could be charged and the full parliament is now expected to formally lift her protection in the coming weeks. British Tory MEP and legal affairs committee member Sajjad Karim said: 'There is a red line between freedom of speech and inciting racial hatred. 'I, along with many other MEPs, today voted to drop Ms Le Pen's immunity and I am confident that the majority of the European Parliament will follow our lead in July.'

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 10:24 EST, 31 January 2014 . | . UPDATED: . 15:22 EST, 31 January 2014 . She is one of the stars of the most unedifying show on television, a single mother who used her airtime to show off modelling pictures as she spoke of her life on Benefits Street. Now thanks to her appearance on the controversial Channel 4 show, 27-year-old Sherrell Dillion, who goes by the nickname SB - or sexy b**** - has apparently been inundated with offers from modelling agencies after agreeing to a newspaper photoshoot. The former takeaway worker said she had . always dreamed of being a model and was even scouted age 22 but then suffered an ectopic pregnancy that left her bedridden for months. Cash-in: Sherrell Dillion appeared in a Daily Star photoshoot . Notorious: Miss Dillions, known as SB, appears on the controversial show with her son . On the most recent episode of the show, she complains of being in debt and says she wants to appear on Deal or No Deal to clear what she owes. Now MIM Agency, a Midlands-based company whose clients include Asda, Littlewoods and ITV, have approached her to be on their books, in spite of the Channel 4 show's notoriety. Benefits Street residents have confessed to cameras that they committed benefits fraud, while one man even let cameras accompany him on a shoplifting spree. Police have been seen on the street several times since the show began speaking to residents, while officers also confirmed they had launched investigations in response to footage from the show. However, undeterred agency owner Amelia Cope told the Daily Star: 'Sherrell has a ""real life"" look that lots of companies we work with will be interested in. Trouble: Police have been at James Turner Street since the show aired - an officer can be seen here leading away Mark Thomas, who told the cameras he had fiddled his benefits . Unsightly: The programme shows that there are often large amounts of rubbish heaped up on the street . Work: Modelling agencies have apparently been unafraid to offer her work, despite the unsavoury associations of the programme . Determined: SB won over the nation on Benefits Street because of her sheer determination - and it's paid off . 'She's also got experience of being in front of the cameras, so we can put her forward for work as an extra with TV companies as well.' SB's offers of work, which she hails as an 'opportunity', are in stark contrast to other, more unsavoury repercussion's of Benefits Streets' runaway success. The show's first episode was widely criticised for following resident Danny Smith around Birmingham city centre on a shoplifting spree. Armed with a shopping bag lines with tinfoil to foil alarm systems, he told cameras: 'Fill it up with a £2,000 coat or whatever you ****ing want, you’ll walk out of the shop and you’re coming out with no alarms going off’, he said. The controversial opener to the five-part documentary also featured Mark Thomas, who lives on James Turner Street with his partner and children, admitting that he fiddled his benefits. The father-of-two was led from his house by police shortly after the revelation. The Daily Mail also revealed that self-proclaimed 'mother of the street' White Dee has a conviction for theft, after swindling Birmingham City Council out of more than £13,000. Televised: Miss Dillion as she appears in publicity for Benefits Street . No strangers: Figures revealed that police are called to James Turner Street every month - a figure likely to have increased after the exposure from Channel 4 . Illegal: The programme's second episode showed an influx of Romanians, including these labourers, who did not have work permits . Notorious: The goings-on of James Turner Street have been exposed to the world after millions tuned in to Benefits Street . More shockingly, community leaders revealed that the shows notoriety has even led to children being bullied for living in Winson Green, the neighbourhood which is home to James Turner Street. Community organised Desmon Jaddoo told MailOnline that concerns had been raised at the Oasis Foundry Academy that children who featured on, or were in some way connected with, the show were subject to playground abuse. In one extreme case, Mr Jaddoo revealed that adults 'were driving down the street hurling abuse' while the children were outside playing. Police last week also raised concerns about scenes featuring a large family of Romanian immigrants, in which a 20-year-old man boasted to cameras that his 'wife' was just 15 years old. He made the comments despite it being illegal to marry at age 15 both in the UK and in Romania, but claimed the set-up was 'no problem' because of his culture. However, the show does not reveal what, if any, benefits Miss Dillion is receiving. Another agency, Spirit, is hoping to set up a test shoot with Miss Dillion due to her real 'potential'. Miss Dillion has also been told she should do dental modelling because she has 'good teeth', but she has her sights set on bikini modelling, the Daily Star reports. Speaking about the response to her photoshoot, SB said: 'I'm just going to try to keep my feet on the ground, but I really hope this will give me an opportunity. Bright future: One agency believe she has real potential but SB maintains that she will keep her feet firmly on the ground . Local celebrity: SB says the locals have been very supportive and even stopped her in the street to wish her luck in her new career . 'Everyone in Turner Street went out and bought the paper and I've had people stopping me in the street to wish me luck.' It was revealed on the show that just 5 per cent of Turner Street in Birmingham's residents are in work. Miss Dillion has also been inundated with supportive messages on social media and even received a message, which has since been deleted, from model Imogen Thomas offering to give her advice. Miss Dillion brought up her two children Terrell, eight, and Kiwi, three, on her own after escaping a violent relationship which saw her ex jailed for two years.

"(CNN) -- The gun outrages continue, the latest the shooting of a gun instructor in Arizona by a 9-year-old girl who was taken to the range by her parents so she could shoot an Uzi, an Israeli-made submachine gun. The question that the whole world asks is this: Why was a 9-year-old girl allowed even to try to shoot a submachine gun? I have a further question: Why does anybody not on the front lines of the military in a war zone need to have access to a submachine gun? It's not as though we haven't had plenty of evidence that this gun thing in America isn't working. Since the ghastly massacre of elementary school children at Sandy Hook on December 14, 2012, by a deranged teenager, as of June there were at least 74 school shootings, on school grounds or in schools themselves. It's commonplace in this country now: A deranged shooter appears, armed to the teeth, out of his mind. Everyone ducks or runs for cover. The shooter proceeds calmly through the building, taking out innocents. What kind of country have we become? Was this what the Founding Fathers had in mind? The NRA will scream: The Second Amendment! The Second Amendment! Please be aware that most of what you think you know about the history of this amendment is nonsense. Many good books and articles exist on the subject, all neatly summarized by Saul Cornell a couple of years ago. He wrote: ""If the nation truly embraced the Second Amendment as it was originally written, it would be the NRA's worst nightmare."" Look at this amendment again: ""A well-regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms, shall not be infringed."" James Madison and the others who framed this single sentence understood perfectly well that you can't have unregulated mobs running around in the streets with guns. That's why ""A well-regulated militia"" goes first in this single sentence. Regulation is the key concept here, which is why the framers foregrounded this clause. So who were these militias in need of regulation? In the South, they were called ""slave patrols,"" and they were paramilitary groups that regularly patrolled slave plantations to make sure restive slaves weren't going to rise up against their white overlords.Remember the line in the movie ""Django Unchained""? Leonardo DiCaprio wonders: ""Why don't they just rise up and kill the whites?"" It was a real question, and the answer was that ""well-regulated militias"" in the Southern states kept the slaves in check. Patrick Henry, George Mason and James Madison knew, as they considered the Second Amendment, that it would be essential if they hoped to get the Southern states to ratify the brand-new U.S. Constitution. It was designed to keep these states on board. There were hundreds of slave uprisings in the South before the Constitution was ratified. For a full history of this, get your hands on Sally E. Haden's book, ""Slave Patrols: Law and Violence in Virginia and the Carolinas."" As Haden demonstrates, most men in the slave states between age 18 and 45 would have had to serve on one of these well-regulated militias at some point. The Southern states were police states designed to keep slaves in check. Their economy had been built around slavery. It is clear in the recorded speeches of Patrick Henry and George Mason, two of the Founding Fathers, that the Second Amendment was specifically handed as a bone to the Southern states, manufactured to keep them happy. James Madison, a slave-holder himself, had no doubt about the need to keep these slave militias going in the South. He wrote about this often and without ambiguity. Thom Hartmann discussed these ideas in a recent article. The National Rifle Association has tried to blur the historical truth about the Second Amendment. In fact, at its headquarters in Washington, the words of the amendment are emblazoned right in front of the entrance. Oops! They have emblazoned exactly half of this brief amendment, leaving off the embarrassing front part, about a ""Well-regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free State."" (Notice also, the amendment says State, not Nation -- and these framers knew the difference, as it's a major difference noted elsewhere in the Bill of Rights.) The idea that owning a gun in America was an individual right only dates to the 1980s. A bunch of right-wing think tanks got to work creating this individual right. In 1991, Chief Justice Warren Burger called this new wrinkle in the Second Amendment ""one of the greatest pieces of fraud -- I repeat the word 'fraud' -- on the American public by special interest groups that I have ever seen in my lifetime."" Burger was right. It's a fraud. There just is no right for the individual to bear arms in the Bill of Rights. You have to belong to a well-regulated militia, such as the National Guard, if you want to bear arms. Of course, the Supreme Court did an end run in recent years around what the framers of the Bill of Rights actually intended. (So much for our famous ""originalists,"" such as Justice Antonin Scalia, who really does whatever he wants and comes up with a bogus argument to say he's going back to what the framers actually meant.)  The 2008 case known as Heller is a botched piece of argumentation, as even conservative judge Richard A. Posner has written, tearing Scalia's opinion to shreds as an incoherent piece of tripe. Let's say, however, that hunters should have the right to possess and use hunting rifles. Why not, if they keep them unloaded except for when hunting? It should be just fine to belong to a gun club and shoot skeet or whatever. But nobody needs an assault weapon who is not fighting in the Middle East, or perhaps going after drug lords in Mexico. Why, then, do Americans love their guns? I will make a bold suggestion. In a country where Americans sense, quite genuinely, that their freedoms have been taken away by the government -- as in the U.S. Patriot Act, as in NSA surveillance -- people feel powerless. It makes you feel more powerful if you can enhance your personal strength with a gun. There is the romance of the Old West, too, which reinforces this idea. It's ""High Noon"" all the time in America. But this is dangerous and false thinking, and it leads to chaos. Chaos is what we now face on the streets in this country every single day. It's time for us to revisit the Second Amendment and get every assault weapon off the streets, for good.","Jay Parini: Only someone on war's front lines should have access to a submachine gun .

"Ronald Koeman believes the summer of change at Southampton helped rather than hindered him as an incoming manager. Saints have been the surprise package of the Barclays Premier League season so far, after a player exodus that many thought would harm the club's chance of making progress actually providing the perfect platform for an early charge out of the blocks. Southampton head to Hull on Saturday with 19 points from their opening nine Premier League fixtures - a points haul bettered only by leaders Chelsea. New boss Ronald Koeman (L) has guided Saints to second in the Premier League after nine games . Koeman saw star players including Adam Lallana (L) and Calum Chambers (R) leave St Mary's . When the likes of Dejan Lovren, Adam Lallana, Rickie Lambert, Luke Shaw and Calum Chambers all left during the summer, the doom-mongers gathered to predict tough times ahead for Koeman. However, the Dutchman thinks being able to stamp his mark on the team from the off has contributed to Saints' flying start to the campaign. 'It helped, although (Dusan) Tadic was already on the scouting list at Southampton,' said Koeman. 'It also came down to positions. Lallana left, so we have to bring in a similar player to Lallana. Lambert goes, so we have to bring in another striker. Spending the money in the positions that we needed was the most important thing. 'But what happened is not normal. Normally you would have to change one or two new players, instead of six or seven players. But this way it is more my team as I have my own players rather than what was left by the other manager. 'Good players, good quality players, can adapt, although it usually takes some time. This team looks like it has already been together for two seasons. But that is down to the players because they are good players.' The Dutchman revealed that star playmaker Dusan Tadic was already being scouted by Southampton . Graziano Pelle (C) has been one of the finds of the season after replacing Rickie Lambert up front . Asked if he thought Southampton could maintain their momentum and realistically challenge for a top-four place this season, Koeman replied: 'We can keep this, I'm not afraid about the situation. 'If I look at the rest of the teams, I don't think a lot of them are better than Southampton. 'I think we have gone under the radar. Maybe some people are very surprised but from the start of the season I saw what I had and I had belief, belief in the players and their spirit. 'Okay, maybe not to be second in the league at this moment, but we have good players and we play good football and everybody enjoys how we play. This is very important.' It is not only in the league that Southampton have excelled this season. Saints won at Stoke in midweek to reach the quarter-finals of the Capital One Cup, where they will face Sheffield United. This graphic shows how much the Saints have improved in attack and defence this season . While Koeman accepts being paired against the Sky Bet League One side gives his team an excellent chance to progress, the Dutchman is not getting carried away by thoughts of Wembley just yet. He said: 'I think it is a good draw because I think it can be worse, maybe Chelsea, Tottenham, Liverpool away. 'You have to be lucky about the draw in a cup. Again it is an away game, that's a pity, but it is a good chance to reach the semi-finals. 'We are doing a good job in the Capital One Cup, we have played three matches away and we have three wins, we have to keep that up in the next game.' 'But it is too early (to start thinking about Wembley), maybe if we reach the semi-final when it is more clear, then it is more realistic.' Another new signing Saido Mane (L) is expected to return against Hull after sitting out of the League Cup win . Sadio Mane could return to the Southampton squad at Hull. Mane was rested as a precaution against Stoke on Wednesday night. The midfielder was expected to train on Friday in the hope that he will be included in the squad that travels to East Yorkshire. Koeman, whose team have won six of their last seven Premier League matches, otherwise has a full squad to select from.","Southampton are second in the Premier League table after a storming start .

Eva, who lives with her parents Sarah and Dean and younger sister in south-east London, was starved of oxygen at birth and has severe cerebral palsy affecting all four limbs. Mrs Justice Elisabeth Laing said that the DVD she had seen of a day in Eva's life was 'very moving'. 'Eva is a beautiful, engaging child. Her eyes shine. She is determined and concentrates hard on any given activity.' In a ruling given today, she added: 'I had a strong sense of an energetic, inquisitive mind trapped in a body that will not do what Eva would wish it could do.'

'This case, as with all of the clinical negligence cases that we handle, was not about money, it was about securing justice. 'No amount of money will ever compensate for the injuries Eva has sustained, but this award will ensure that she is provided with the care she needs for the rest of her life, and has the opportunity to live her life to the fullest.

"QPR manager Harry Redknapp is not to blame for the team's position at the bottom of the Premier League, according to Rangers midfielder Adel Taarabt. Redknapp's side were beaten 2-0 by West Ham on Sunday meaning the team have taken just four points from their opening seven league games. QPR's defeat was compounded by a sluggish display that has placed added scrutiny on Redknapp and his ability to motivate his under-performing players. Adel Taarabt said Harry Redknapp is not to blame for QPR's poor form after their defeat to West Ham . 'It is easy to blame the manager when you lose but the players have to step up,' said Taarabt, who came on for 24 minutes at Upton Park but is yet to start a match this season. 'The manager can change tactics, tell us what he wants, but when we go on the pitch it is the players who perform. 'It is disappointing, we are bottom of the league. 'If we keep clean sheets we can win games, but at the moment we are not doing that so it is hard for us.' QPR were relegated under Redknapp during his first season in charge and could be again this season . Redknapp said his players' fitness was not up to scratch after the West Ham defeat, with a number of his squad still regaining sharpness after injury. Taarabt has been struggling with an ankle problem since the summer and the talented Moroccan is still trying to re-establish himself at Loftus Road after a permanent move to AC Milan break down in the summer. 'I was in the middle of a transfer and it did not happen for whatever reason,' Taarabt said. 'It was difficult for me because I thought I was moving. In the end it did not happen, so I am now and have to work hard to get back in the team and help QPR win games. The talented Moroccan midfielder, who was on loan at AC Milan last year, said the players were to blame . 'These two weeks for the international break will help me get to 100 per cent. I did not have a very good pre-season and I need games. Hopefully my ankle will be fine, it is not a big injury.' Taarabt scored four goals in 14 league appearances while on loan at Milan last season and the 25-year-old admits he had hoped to sign permanently for the Italian giants in the summer. 'I had a taste of something different last year, playing in the Champions League at a big club [while on loan at AC Milan],' Taarabt said. 'That is why I wanted to move. Not because I do want to be at QPR, because it was a big opportunity for me. 'Do not forget that this club has helped me a lot. I am one of the longest-serving players here now, and I still love the club. It will always be in my heart. I am very concentrated on QPR and giving my best.'

"Controversial independent senator Jacqui Lambie has interrupted Senate tributes for fallen cricketer Phillip Hughes, in a bid to force a rushed debate on her private bill to raise Defence pay. In an attempt to hijack the government's agenda in the final days of the parliamentary year, Senator Lambie cut short a move to honour the young cricketer who died last week. Under fire for her contentious move Senator Jacqui Lambie has offered an apology to the family and friends of Phillip Hughes. Scroll down for video . Senator Jacqui Lambie's sense of timing has been called into question after bringing Senate tributes to fallen cricketer Phillip Hughes to a halt to introduce a debate on defence pay . Phillip Hughes will be farewelled at a funeral to be held at his old high school in Macksville . She stated: 'Like the President of the Senate, I thought that Phillip Hughes’ condolence motion was finalised, so I proceeded with my attempt to suspend standing orders, so that I could debate my Legislation, which would have guaranteed that members of our ADF receive a pay rise.' The controversy coincided with Philip Hughes' funeral in his home town of Macksville on the NSW mid-north coast. After a few moments of confusion, the Senate agreed to finalise its tributes to Hughes with a minute's silence. Senator Lambie then moved to suspend all other business so that senators could debate her bill. The move was supported by Labor but was defeated 34-33. Senator Lambie's bill links ADF pay to that of politicians or CPI, whichever is greater. Controversy has followed Senator Jacqui Lambie in Canberra on Wednesday after she curtailed tributes to fallen cricketer Phillip Hughes to ignite a debate on defence pay . It follows her pledge to vote against all government legislation until the government reconsiders the 1.5 per cent defence pay increased. The government greeted Senator Lambie's move with hostility, initially denying her the right to speak. 'I'm asking you to give me a fair go and show me some courtesy,' she bellowed at government Senate leader Eric Abetz. 'This isn't about me, this is about the men and women who wear the uniform.' In her statement Ms Lambie added: 'It was the first time that I moved a suspension of standing orders - and it appears that some want to use the slight confusion created over the transition from one Senate procedure to another, against me. 'I apologise to Phillip Hughes’ family and friends if my misunderstanding over Senate procedure has offended them. This must be a very difficult and sad day for them. The speeches given in the Senate for Phillip were magnificent and inspirational.' Jacqui Lambie described Labor Senator John Faulkner's speech as particularly moving, speaking with 'eloquence, passion and compassion'.",Outrage at Jacqui Lambie's tactics to stop tributes to Phillip Hughes in the Senate to turn attention to a debate on defence pay .

"(CNN) -- A Maryland man severely injured in an alleged assault at a Baltimore Orioles baseball game was revived by an off-duty state trooper at the scene who apparently didn't know immediately the victim was a childhood friend. Nathan Steelman was seated a few sections away on Wednesday night at Camden Yards when Matthew Fortese, 25, was punched in the side of the head during an apparent argument with two other men and fell off a wall, police records show. His head hit the pavement below with a loud thump. The incident apparently was triggered when the men sitting in the section behind Fortese apparently taunted him about his New York Yankees hat and threw beer on him, his brother, James, said. Fortese was not breathing and was bleeding badly from behind his head when Steelman reached him. Steelman pried open his mouth and cleared his airway, allowing Fortese to breathe on his own, Steelman said. It wasn't until later that Steelman realized he had known Fortese for years. ""I think instinct kind of kicked in,"" Steelman told CNN on Friday. ""I didn't know it was Matt at the time."" ""I grew up with him playing baseball together,"" Steelman said. Fortese remains in intensive care in stable condition with a fractured skull at Maryland Shock Trauma Center, James Fortese said. ""He's not confrontational,"" his brother told CNN. ""He was just trying to enjoy the game."" Two men were charged in the incident and were held on $50,000 bond, authorities said.

"(CNN) -- As Hurricane Rafael sped away from Bermuda, taking with it heavy rain and wind, the government discontinued storm watches for the island. There appeared to be minimal disruption to life on Bermuda as the fast-moving storm roared by to the east, keeping the strongest winds well away from land. About 600 homes lost power, the Bermuda Electric Light Company said on its Facebook page. Glenn Jones, a business development and marketing manager for a Bermudian media company, said earlier that the wind was stronger than some locals expected. According to the Bermuda Weather Service, wind speeds reached 51 mph at the airport Tuesday night. The outer bands of the Category 1 hurricane had swirled over the 21-square-mile island as the storm raced north-northeast during the afternoon, bringing tropical storm-force winds and downpours. Late Tuesday, Rafael was about 135 miles (215 kilometers) east of the island, the National Hurricane Center in Miami said. Meteorologists said the storm, with 85 mph sustained wind, was moving at 29 mph. Rafael becomes hurricane as it churns towards Bermuda . Forecasters said Rafael will break up late Wednesday or early Thursday after a turn to the northeast. Bermuda might see 2 to 4 inches of rain from the storm, and some beaches in the Bahamas and the eastern United States will see swells caused by Rafael. Meanwhile, along the Pacific coast of Mexico, Paul turned into a tropical storm and turned away from the Mexican coast without the center of the storm ever making landfall. CNN's Catherine E.

Step-daughter Bianca, 27, was seen at a premiere of the film Sin City 2 on Wednesday, the day before her step-father was seen clutching a . bottle of gin as he staggered . around outside his home.

Twitter trolls accused the former footballer's step-daughter of not being there for her step-father . But she hit back, accusing the trolls of not knowing what they are talking about . One webuser wrote: 'At a premier (sic) yet 4 hrs later thanking Paul's well wishes. Here's a thought, be with him 4hr earlier' Another asked: 'Why aren't you there for him now he clearly needs you?' One online bullying told the glamour model her step-father was 'done' and another branded Bianca 'attention seeking'. Bianca hit back this afternoon, tweeting: 'There are some sick twisted . people out there have some compassion don't know why people feel the . need to be so nasty & have opinions they know nothing about.' Her response came as it emerged Gascoigne could be forced out of the £3million rented home he has been living in on the south coast. The director of the management company in . charge of the flats where Gascoigne has been living today dismissed . claims he is being evicted, but said his landlord was not renewing the rental contract. Christopher Eales, 84, said: 'The only thing I can tell you is that he has not been asked to leave. 'His lease will run out on September 13 and the landlord will not be renewing the contract as he wants the flat back.' The former England footballer was seen with his head in his hands outside his home in Sandbanks, Dorset . After being spotted with cans of beer, he was escorted away by police and an ambulance crew . The news came after shocking . pictures emerged showing the former player - once the country's most gifted . midfielder - slumped, head in hands, outside his penthouse apartment. Gascoigne was . taken from the flat by medics and driven to Poole . Hospital yesterday afternoon and he remained there this morning. QPR manager Harry Redknapp, who also . lives in Sandbanks, today offered Gascoigne the chance to work alongside . him in football. He . said: 'I saw him about a month ago and said ""I'll pick you up in the . mornings, Gazza, come training with me and do a bit of work with the . kids"". I’d love it if he could do that. It's an open invitation. 'He's a great lad and it's sad to see what’s happened to him and how he's looking at the moment.' In a TV documentary shown last . September, Gascoigne described the pain of fearing he might start . drinking again, despite knowing it could kill him. The former footballer looked much older than his 47 years as walked around with a bottle of spirits . Dressed in a pair of slippers and holding a bag full of cans of lager, the  star looked a shadow of his former self . It is believed worried neighbours called emergency services after the 47-year-old was seen drinking . Gascoigne is believed to have been taken to hospital for his own safety after he was again seen drinking . Gascoigne spoke of his addiction and a previous relapse earlier this year in the . ITV show Being Paul Gascoigne. He said: 'I just . remember one bit after the third day of being in hospital when he (the . doctor) said ""I don't think this guy is going to make it"" and I sort of . put my head up a little bit and I was like, tubes in my arms and an . oxygen tank injecting round my heart and lungs and that.' He added: 'I just come forward and I . went ""I don't want to die, I need to water the plants"" and that was it . and then I woke up two weeks later. 'With . me now, if I did have a drink and relapse, it's like becoming tipsy and . merry is OK for a couple of days but like the next mouthful I'm so . down, I'm so depressed, I cry. 'I . do all that because I know inside I'm hurting myself again. I know . where I'm heading - a wooden box. Or I'm back in treatment or hospital. Or getting sectioned.' The one-time England star looked unsteady on his feet as he walked around Sandbanks in Dorset . Gascoigne has long battled drinking problems and went to a rehab centre in the US last year to save himself . He was taken to nearby Poole Hospital for his own safety after worried neighbours raised the alarm . It had been claimed that Gascoigne . was set to make his return to football after a journey for cigarettes . led him to meet taxi driver and Abbey FC manager Chris Foster - who . convinced the former England international to sign for the Hayward . Sunday League side. The . 47-year-old enjoyed a memorable professional career which saw him play for the likes of Newcastle United, Tottenham Hotspur, Lazio and Rangers, whilst . also becoming a firm favourite among many England supporters. Gascoigne, who has been plagued by . alcoholism and drug addiction, last played professional football trn years ago when he made five appearances for then-League Two side Boston . United. Daren Hills, secretary of the Bournemouth Football Association, confirmed that his registration has been received. A spokesman for Gascoigne decline to comment on the incident outside his home. Gascoigne's former teammates rallied around today as the star remained in Poole Hospital. Chris Waddle, who played in the 1990 World Cup where Gascoigne made his name, took to twitter to offer his support. He tweeted: 'I know it's hard to stay focused but you have so many people who want you to come through this come on stay strong' Above a picture of the pair playing together for England, he then added: 'Love you mate' Another of Gascoigne's Italia '90 teammates, Match of the Day Presenter Gary Lineker, also offered a serious message for the troubled star. In comments reported in the Daily Record, he said: 'Ultimately the support has got to come from Gazza himself. 'We've supported him over years, Tottenham and his friends. I wish him well but ultimately it's got to come from Paul.' The former midfielder shot to worldwide fame after his performances at the 1990 World Cup . Gascoigne - once one of the country's most gifted players -  was seen slumped outside his penthouse apartment in Sandbanks, Dorset. He was later taken to Poole Hospital . Gascoigne was accused of being 'under the influence of alcohol' while manager of Kettering in 2005 . 1998 -The full extent of Gascoigne's drinking problems became clear when he was still playing. He was checked into the Priory rehab clinic in 1998 by his then-manager at Middlesborough, Bryan Robson. The treatment followed a year of trauma during which he was dropped from England's World Cup squad, divorced from wife Sheryl and faced the death from alcoholic poisoning of close friend, David Cheek, after they had spent a night out together. He was released, at his own insistence, two weeks into the suggested minimum stay of 28 days. 2001 - After joining Everton he missed a friendly with Tranmere during Everton's pre-season build-up. It later emerged he was attending a rehabilitation clinic in Arizona, USA, where he was diagnosed with bi-polar disorder. 2004 - After a spell with a Chinese B-league side, Gascoigne returned to Britain but was involved in a car accident when he drove his four-wheel drive BMW into a parked truck. He escaped without serious injury and later joined Boston United as player-coach, before leaving after just two matches. In a bizarre episode, he then announced he wanted to change his name to G8. 2005 -  The former England football star was hospitalised with pneumonia. He was later appointed manager of non-league Kettering, but left the club after 39 days following claims by the club's chairman that he was 'under the influence of alcohol before, during and after several first-team games and training sessions'. Gascoigne denied the claims, insisting: 'I had a double brandy before one of the games, but it used to be four bottles of whiskey a day - it's not now.' 2008 - Gascoigne was sectioned after reportedly wielding a steak knife in the Malmaison hotel in Newcastle. The . hotel's manager said at the time that he was 'potentially a menace to other . guests. The guests in the room next to him were moved out as they felt . intimidated.' Gascoigne leaves Newcastle Magistrates Court in 2010 after getting a suspended sentence for drink driving . 2010 - Gascoigne appeared at the scene of a tense police stand-off with killer Raoul Moat, reportedly claiming he had brought the gunman 'a can of lager, some chicken, a fishing rod, a Newcastle shirt and a dressing gown'. He later said of the incident: 'I thought, ""Moaty won’t shoot me, I’m good friends with him"". I thought I knew him, but I’d been drinking.' Later that year he was given a suspended prison sentence for drink-driving after magistrates heard he was four times the legal limit. 2013 - After slurring his words and appearing confused in a charity stage show, Gascoigne was again sent to the US for treatment. Footballers past and present and friends Chris Evans and cricketer Ronnie Irani contributed to his rehab fund. After returning to Britain, he was found slumped outside a London hotel. He was later fined £1,000 for assaulting a railway security guard in Stevenage and being drunk and disorderly. 2014 - Earlier this year, Gascoigne again entered an extensive rehabitilition programme at a £6,000-a-month clinic in Southhampton, the seventh time he had entered such a facility. He received treatment again last year after appearing confused at a charity function in Northampton .",Pictures emerged of Gascoigne wandering around with lager and spirits .

""This has an important symbolic meaning. We have arrived at the stage when we don't want to be vassals any more,"" said opposition activist Ilya Ponomaryov, who picked up hitchhikers with white ribbons in his purple sedan. 'We want to show our unity. This is very visible. This is preparatory work for February 4, when there will be even more people than on Sakharov Avenue,' Ponomaryov said, referring to the site of a December 24 rally that drew tens of thousands. Polls indicate Putin will regain the presidency, extending his rule for at least six more years, although he is under pressure to show he can ensure a fair win. He was president from 2000-2008 and is widely believed to have been holding Russia's reins for his protege, President Dmitry Medvedev. 'This has an important symbolic meaning.

Cars are a strong symbol not only of status but of personal freedom in Russia and the right to choice in a country where even ownership of a tiny Soviet-made Lada was a luxury in the communist era and foreign cars were virtually non-existent. The protests, provoked by widespread suspicions of fraud favouring Putin's ruling party in a December 4 parliamentary election, have revealed dismay among Russians. Middle-class city dwellers in particular feel they have no say in politics and that Putin's decision to return to the Kremlin was thrust upon them. 'We have to fight for our rights... We have to show our strength so that maybe people will see us and come to the February 4 protest,' said Nadezhda, 26, who works for a state TV station. Nadezhda, who declined to give her last name, said her station had told employees not to take part in Sunday's protest. 'I feel cheated by the vote,' Yevgeny Starshov, 23, a student at a state school of public administration, said of the parliamentary election. 'We have to do something to change the country for the better, not through riots or some kind of revolution but through such peaceful demonstrations to fight for more fair elections.""

Nestlé, the world's biggest food company, has removed several beef pasta ready meals from sale in Italy and Spain after finding traces of horse DNA. It is hugely embarrassing for the Swiss-based giant, because just last week . it insisted its products had not been affected by the scandal. But last night the firm admitted its own tests . had found more than one per cent horse DNA in two products. Recall: Nestlé has been forced to withdraw processed beef products from shops in Italy and Spain .

'We have informed the authorities accordingly,' Nestlé said in a statement on Monday. 'There is no food safety issue.' Nestle withdrew two chilled pasta products, Buitoni Beef Ravioli and Beef Tortellini, in Italy and Spain. Lasagnes à la Bolognaise Gourmandes, a catering product produced in France, will also be withdrawn. The company insists that none of its products on sale in the UK are affected. Scandal: Frozen foods company Findus is one of the firms which has been forced to withdraw frozen products . Nestlé has suspended deliveries of all products made using beef from a German subcontractor to one of its suppliers. Governments across Europe have stressed that horsemeat poses little or no health risk, although some carcasses have been found tainted with a painkiller banned for human consumption. But the scandal has damaged the confidence of consumers in supermarkets and fast food chains since horsemeat was first identified in Irish beefburgers. Budget retailer Lidl said on Monday it had withdrawn products from its stores in Finland and Sweden after finding traces of horsemeat. Other supermarket chains which have been drawn in to the scandal include Tesco and Asda, while frozen foods company Findus was forced to withdraw its beef lasagne.

"(CNN) -- And they're off! Tens of millions of Americans are on the move for the annual November trek to see family and friends, feast on turkey and pumpkin pie, and rediscover the joys of their hometown on Thanksgiving. You probably know the drill: packed airports, crowded flights and lots of out-of-state license plates on the road. All eyes are on the weather, which can turn a simple trip into a nightmare -- cue visions of Steve Martin and John Candy struggling to get to snowy Chicago in ""Planes, Trains and Automobiles."" Should you recline your seat? The etiquette of crowded flying . Travelers faced stormy conditions in the Pacific Northwest, the threat of floods and severe storms in the South, lots of rain in the Northeast and the possibility of snow in parts of New England. On Tuesday afternoon, weather-related flight delays were reported at airports including Philadelphia International, O'Hare, Newark International, LaGuardia and John F. Kennedy International. Check FAA flight delay information . But the threat of bad weather is not keeping people home. AAA projects that 42.5 million Americans will travel at least 50 miles during the Thanksgiving weekend, an increase of 4% from last year. Slightly fewer people are choosing to get to their destinations by plane. About 23.2 million travelers will fly over a 12-day period surrounding Turkey Day, a 2% drop from last year, according to a forecast by the Air Transport Association of America. Unlike last year, when the ""National Opt-Out Day"" movement against airport body scanners threatened to snarl security lines across the country, air travelers are not facing the prospect of protest-induced delays. (The Opt-Out Day turned out to be a non-event.) The TSA says it's preparing its work force for a ""smooth holiday travel experience for travelers."" iReport: Tell us how your trip is going . The busiest air travel days for the Thanksgiving holiday period are expected to be Sunday, November 27, and Monday, November 28, the Air Transport Association of America said. If you're flying into or out of Los Angeles International, Chicago's O'Hare International or Orlando International, brace yourself for lots of company. Those will be the nation's busiest airports this Thanksgiving, based on flight bookings, according to Orbitz.com. (And in case you're wondering, Mineta San Jose International in California and Kahului Airport in Maui, Hawaii, will be the least busy.) No matter where you start your journey, flight attendants say, it's a week when they see lots of extra-grumpy passengers worried about flight delays and cancellations. ""There's a little bit more at stake. Oftentimes, people are trying to get someplace to be with their family, so naturally they would be upset if they're not going to make it,"" said Rene Foss, a veteran flight attendant for a major U.S. airline. ""However, in general, it's also kind of a festive time. Sometimes, contrary to what you might think, people are in a good mood because they are going for something kind of fun as opposed to just a business meeting or something related to work."" Flying with food or gifts? Check out the TSA's guide to what you can and cannot bring through an airport security checkpoint. The agency reminds you not to wrap gifts you are taking on the plane because security officers may have to unwrap them if they need to take a closer look. The TSA also offers tips on how to get through the security line faster, including packing coats and jackets in checked bags whenever possible and putting your shoes directly on the conveyor belt instead of a bin when they go through the X-ray machine. Then, there are things you can't control: Snow, fog or rain may mean you won't fly on time or at all.

"Climate change alarmists have been likened to a fanatical 'cult' by an MIT professor of meteorology. Dr Richard Lindzen told a Massachusetts-based radio station that people who believe in global warming are becoming more hysterical in their arguments. 'As with any cult, once the mythology of the cult begins falling apart, instead of saying, oh, we were wrong, they get more and more fanatical,' he said. Dr Richard Lindzen (right) told a Massachusetts-based radio station that people who believe in global warming (stock pictured left) are becoming more hysterical in their arguments. 'As with any cult, once the mythology of the cult begins falling apart, instead of saying, oh, we were wrong, they get more and more fanatical,' he said . 'You've led an unpleasant life, you haven't led a very virtuous life, but now you're told, you get absolution if you watch your carbon footprint. It's salvation.' According to Howie Carr at Breitbart, the 74-year-old highlighted reports by Nasa that 2014 was the hottest year in recorded history. He points out that the Nasa climate scientists who made the claim was only 38 per cent sure this was true. 'Seventy per cent of the Earth is oceans, we can't measure those temperatures very well,' he said. 'They can be off a half a degree, a quarter of a degree. In 1990, the UN's climate panel predicted with ‘substantial confidence’ that the world would warm at twice the rate that has been observed since.  The IPCC report found that, by the end of the century, the emission of greenhouse gases will bring temperatures that are about 3.7°C (6.7°F) warmer . The latest Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report was published in November. It said continued emission of greenhouse gases will cause further warming and long-lasting changes. This will increase the likelihood of 'severe, pervasive and irreversible impacts for people and ecosystems.' Such impacts include extreme weather and rising sea levels, heat waves, flooding and droughts. Ocean acidification, which comes from the added carbon absorbed by oceans, will harm marine life. Without changes in emissions, 'climate change risks are likely to be high or very high by the end of the 21st century.' At the current rate, by mid-century temperatures will increase by about another 2°C (3.6°F) compared to temperatures from 1986 to 2005. By the end of the century, that scenario will bring temperatures that are about 3.7°C (6.7°F) warmer. The impact on the Earth could already be considered dangerous, the report claimed. 'Even two-10ths of a degree of change would be tiny but two-100ths is ludicrous. Anyone who starts crowing about those numbers shows that they're putting spin on nothing.' Dr Lindzen was a lead author of Chapter 7, 'Physical Climate Processes and Feedbacks,' of the IPCC Third Assessment Report on climate change. But he has previously blasted the IPCC for blaming humans for a global warming trend that appears to have cooled in recent decades – and then glossing over the warming slowdown. 'I think that the latest IPCC report has truly sunk to level of hilarious incoherence,' Dr Lindzen told Climate Depot – a site known for questioning the theory of global warming. A number of studies have suggested that powerful winds in the Pacific Ocean, which have driven surface heat deep underwater, could be the reason behind the current 'pause' in global warming. The IPCC has said that rising temperatures will exacerbate poverty and damage land and marine species. It also claims that the world is in 'an era of man-made climate change' and has already seen impacts of global warming on every continent and across the oceans. On Tuesday, President Obama said that 'no challenge poses a greater threat to future generations than climate change'. He has pledged that he would veto legislation turning back White House efforts on the environment. Since 1880, Earth’s surface temperature has warmed by about 1.4 degrees Fahrenheit (0.8 degrees Celsius). The IPCC says rising temperatures will exacerbate poverty and damage land and marine species .","Comments were made by professor of meteorology, Richard Lindzen .

"By . Ollie Gillman for MailOnline . Louise Hitchen stole more than £96,000 and spent it on a boob job, a car and holidays to Ghana and Ireland, but will only pay £23,892 back . Scroll down for video . An office manager who stole nearly £100,000 from her clients to pay for a boob job and a sports car will only have to give around a quarter of the money back. Louise Hitchen, 27, swindled £96,620 while working at a PPI claims firm and was jailed for 12 months in May. The mother-of-one diverted the funds to her own bank account on 15 different occasions, and spent £3,000 on breast enhancement during a downward spiral into drink and drug abuse. Hitchen, from Newton-le-Willows, Merseyside, also blew thousands of pounds of clients' cash on holidays to Holland and Ghana, an abortion, online shopping and a Vauxhall Astra convertible. A proceeds of crime hearing at Liverpool Crown Court heard that Hitchens, who worked for Hardwick Financial Solutions, in Wigan, had assets worth £23,849 and had paid this money back in an out-of-court settlement. At her sentencing in May, a jury heard how Hitchen's offending began when she secretly transferred £3,000 funds to her own bank account to pay for an abortion. Greed quickly took over and by the time her fraud came to light she had already left the firm having taken £93,000. The company had to halt plans for expansion and 10 members of staff were laid off as a result. Jailing her, Judge Robert Warnock said 'A significant driving force behind this fraud was greed and the wish to artificially boost her own self-esteem.' When she joined the company in March 2011 she was described as “keen and enthusiastic”, but by July the following year her performance had deteriorated and she was subject to disciplinary proceedings. Hitchen spent £3,000 of the stolen money on breast enlargement, and was jailed in May for 12 months . Hitchen's 'The Only Way is Essex' lifestyle drew the attention of her boss because she was spending fare more than she earned, but she told him her boyfriend was sending her money from overseas . Her line manager became suspicious when she started living a 'The Only Way is Essex' lifestyle, buying a car, having her breasts enlarged and buying clothes online, but Hitchen claimed her boyfriend worked overseas and was sending her cash. She left the company in October 2012, but in December that year a client complained that they had not been paid out and investigations revealed that the cash had gone into Hitchen’s payroll bank account. Hitchen claimed it had been 'a one-off', but inquires showed more payments totalling £28,574. She paid £20,000 back then, as well as handing over her car. In March 2013 another client complained that they had not been paid out and it was found that Hitchen had diverted other funds to herself but destroyed the audit trail. It was only then that the full extent of her fraud was revealed. The company, Hardwick Financial Solutions (offices pictured), had to lay off 10 staff because of the lost money . Speaking after the sentencing in May, Detective Constable Mark Edwards, from Greater Manchester Police, said: 'In the space of about four months Louise Hitchen stole close to £100,000. 'With the exception of the cosmetic surgery and car - which has since been returned - Louise Hitchen frittered away much of the cash on shopping sprees and trips out. 'The cost to Hardwick Financial Solutions LTD has been significant and has included staff losing their jobs but the only person Louise thought about while she had her ""hand in the till"" was herself.'","Louise Hitchen swindled £96,620 while working at a PPI claims firm .

"The baby orangutan who spent most of his short life trapped inside a chicken cage has met another ape for the very first time. Budi was dying from malnutrition and too weak to move when a British  charity discovered him in Borneo. After making a remarkable recovery, an new astonishing video shows him interacting - and playing with - an equally adorable baby orangutan called Jemmi. They have both been raised by workers at International Animal Rescue - the charity who care for them - hope their friendship means they will become less dependent on 'human babysitters'. First encounter: Budi (right) - the baby orangutan who spent most of his short life trapped in a cage - has met another ape for the very first time . Playtime: Budi (top) was much more shy than his new friend Jemmi (bottom) who curiously inspected the rescued orangutan . New friends: After spending ten months caged and alone, a new video shows Budi (left) joyfully playing with another primate . Reaching out: International Animal Rescue - the charity that saved Budi (bottom) - hope his friendship with Jemmi will mean they both become less dependent on humans . Recovery: Budi (top) was too weak to even open his mouth when they discovered him inside a chicken cage in December, but he is now strong enough to swing and play . Momentous: The charity's chief executive said the 'first meeting is a milestone in the development of both babies' The video released by charity International Animal Rescue captures Budi and Jemmi's incredible first encounter and shows them curiously inspecting each other before exploring their surroundings. Before Budi was rescued, his owner had never  given him a single mouthful of solid food for fear it would be bad for him - leaving his tiny limbs swollen and bent. But the wonderful new footage shows his transformation from that frail and helpless baby into an inquisitive animal who is now strong enough to swing from trees. He looks visibly shy when he first meets new playmate, who looks delighted to have a new friend and reaches out to touch him. Eight-month-old Jemmi was orphaned when her mother was killed and then illegally sold as a pet. Despite Budi's initial hesitation, it's not long before the two are climbing the hammock together and a 'bond of friendship is beginning to form between them'. The Chief Executive of the charity that rescued Budi hopes his new-found friendship with Jemmi gets them both used to orangutans so they can hopefully be released into the wild some day. Alan Knight said: 'As they start to form bonds with each other and then with other orangutans in baby school, they will learn from each other how to behave in the forest and gradually shed their dependence on their human babysitters.'

Neglect: Before Budi was rescued, his owner had never given him a single mouthful of solid food for fear it would be bad for him - leaving his tiny limbs swollen and bent . 'We couldn't be happier to see how well Budi is getting on with his new playmate. This first meeting is a milestone in the development of both babies.' Budi was in a critical condition when International Animal Rescue found him in Indonesia in December and immediately took him to their orangutan rehabilitation centre. At just over one year old, he should have been able to climb and swing but the helpless baby was too weak to even open his mouth. Earlier footage showed him crying in pain when one of his carers gently turned his body or lifted him to sit up. But thanks to intensive treatment and care from International Animal Rescue's veterinary team, he made a remarkable recovery. Recent videos released by the charity showed Budi drinking from a bottle unaided, eating pureed food from a spoon and doing some physical therapy. In another video he is shown fast asleep, exhausted after his physical exertions. The baby orangutan become an internet sensation after his story was first told by MailOnline. Transformation: The change in Budi in a few short weeks is remarkable. Here he is pictured exercising at the rescue centre in Borneo . Strength: The tiny orangutan didn't have the muscle strength to open his mouth when he was first rescued from a life of neglect . Release: International Animal Rescue's chief executive said: 'They will learn from each other how to behave in the forest and gradually shed their dependence on their human babysitters' International Animal Rescue are keen to stress that Budi's story is not an isolate case and there are 'countless' orangutans currently suffering from neglect in Indonesia. The charity is currently caring for 83 orangutans who were being kept illegally as pets. The primates of all ages are now undergoing rehabilitation so they can eventually be released back into the wild. Mr Knight added: 'People are being very generous in their response to Budi's story and I would urge everyone please to keep on supporting us. 'The more people give, the more orangutans we can rescue and help on their journey back to a protected place in the forest where they belong.'",Baby orangutan Budi was too weak to move when he was rescued in January .

"A married couple who were so desperate to be parents they sold all their valuables to fund costly fertility treatment finally have the baby of their dreams - after winning a competition. Chris and Amanda Schlatter, from Nevada, had tried unsuccessfully for 12 years to fall pregnant, attempting to conceive naturally - even experimenting with fertility-boosting yoga hanging upside down after intercourse. But after finding themselves broke after almost a decade of unsuccessful attempts, the pair ended up winning the chance to have a baby in a competition run by an IVF charity - and this week celebrate the second birthday of their son Noah. Chris and Amanda Schlatter, from Nevada, celebrate their son Noah's 2nd birthday this week . Noah, pictured newborn, was conceived after Chris wrote a heartfelt plea to the charity Babyquest explaining the couples years of fertility struggles . After starting to after visiting a fertility clinic in December 2009, tests found Mr Schlatter had low testosterone levels and Mrs Schlatter was diagnosed with endometriosis, a polycystic ovary and a blocked fallopian tube. The couple started IUI – intrauterine insemination – which involves separating out the fastest moving sperm and placing them in the womb. But the costly treatment meant they were forced to sell possessions in their home to cover the $10,000 (£6000) cost. 'We became so desperate to get pregnant we sold everything of value in our home, to fund the IUI,' Mrs Schlatter, 30, said. Amanda and Chris on their wedding day: 'When I married my wife my intention was to give her the world, but instead we have known struggle' Chris said in his prize-winning letter . Left: The couple when they first met; Right: Pictured recently with Noah as he turns two . 'With each treatment I hoped we'd get pregnant. And when each one failed we'd pin our hopes on the next. But we had six goes and none of them were successful. 'My wife and I have seen hardships but none greater than what we currently face. 'In the first months of our relationship Amanda and I would sit and talk for hours about our future children. 'Our initial failures did not alarm us, our panic did not begin until we'd been trying several years. 'We understood conceiving a baby can sometimes take more time for some than others. We needed to try harder but nothing worked. 'After several failed attempts the heartbreak became more intense. 'When I married my wife my intention was to give her the world, but instead we have known struggle. 'As we read about your [the charity's] work, our hopes began to rise to know there are organisations that still exist to help people and ease the pain of others. 'The pain of infertility is brutal and the tears have been frequent. With your [the charity's] help, those tears can finally be dried.' 'I felt bitter that other people had children and felt sad and jealous when friends started having babies. 'In the end our doctor said: ""Any further treatment along these lines would be a waste of money""'. 'IVF became our only option after this, but we knew it would be expensive, and we'd run out of things to sell by this point.' Amazingly, it was Mr Schlatter's magical words that saw them get pregnant after they beat 99 other couples to win funding for IVF treatment. After researching treatment options online, the couple came across a charity, Baby Quest Foundation, which was granting struggling couples the funding for IVF. So Mr Schlatter, 34, applied, explaining why he and his wife would make perfect parents, and should receive the help. 'His letter was so heartfelt,' Mrs Schlatter explained. 'He wrote about our struggle to conceive and about how heart-breaking it had been for us with every negative pregnancy test.' Incredibly, two months later, in April 2012, the couple got the call to say they'd won the funding. And less than a year later, in March 2013, their son Noah was born. Mrs Schlatter said: 'When the doctor said the words I never thought I'd hear – 'you're pregnant' I couldn't stop smiling. 'After eight years of trying we were finally going to have a family of our own – thanks to Chris' beautiful words. Left: Miracle baby Noah pictured recently; Right: A newborn Noah in March 2013 . Mrs Schlatter (pictured when she was pregnant in 2013) said: 'When the doctor said the words I never thought I'd hear – 'you're pregnant' I couldn't stop smiling. 'Chris and I had first spoken about having kids a year after we met when I was 18 and he was 22. We were young, but all we ever wanted to be was parents.' Speaking of her struggle to fall pregnant naturally, Mrs Schlatter continued: 'It just didn't happen naturally for us. So we tried natural treatments. I took vitamins and did yoga to boost my fertility. 'I even hung upside down, any stupid thing that was suggested, to get me pregnant. 'We tried not to worry, but as our friends started having families we couldn't help it. 'Our sex life became like a military operation. Each day I'd take my temperature, and work out which day of the month I'd be most fertile. Then we'd take time off work specifically to try and conceive. 'Having sex stopped being romantic. It was like a chore and not fun.' Mrs Schlatter said of Noah (pictured recently): 'We have nothing but thanks for the charity who've made our family possible. Noah is our miracle baby' Mrs Schlatter, pictured  pregnant, is due to start the process of trying to get pregnant again, with the embryos created during their winning IVF treatment . During their plight to be parents, Mrs Schlatter admits convincing herself that she was pregnant every time her period was late, and whenever she had an ache or pain, she put it down to a symptom of pregnancy. The mum-of-one, said: 'Every month another test would be negative and I'd make excuses, like I'd tested too early, and try again. 'We did hundreds of tests and they were always negative. It seemed like the one thing I wanted I couldn't have. I was ashamed that I couldn't do what a woman is supposed to do, or give my husband what he wanted.' The couple, who celebrate Noah's 2nd birthday this week, are due to start the process of trying to get pregnant again, with the embryos created during their winning IVF treatment. Mrs Schlatter added: 'We have nothing but thanks for the charity who've made our family possible. Noah is our miracle baby, and we hope now to give him a brother or sister. 'Without winning that treatment, Chris and I would still be struggling to have a baby and still going through all that heartache. We really couldn't be more thrilled that we won. Noah is by far the best prize we could've hoped for.' The mum-of-one, said: 'Every month another test would be negative and I'd make excuses, like I'd tested too early, and try again. Mrs Schlatter, pictured pregnant, said before winning the competition: 'IVF became our only option after this, but we knew it would be expensive, and we'd run out of things to sell '","Chris and Amanda Schlatter from Nevada tried naturally for eight years .

"Freddy Ovett describes himself as ‘50-50’ British and Australian, though the soft Queensland accent seems a giveaway. It isn’t quite as simple as that, because Freddy is the son of Steve, 1980 Olympic 800 metres gold medallist and a legend of British sport, whose rivalry with Sebastian Coe captivated a global audience. Three decades on, Freddy is forging his own path — but as a cyclist, not a runner, having switched sports 18 months ago and made such rapid progress that he has trained with Chris Froome, the 2013 Tour de France winner, and recently signed with France’s top development team. Cyclist Freddy Ovett is all smiles as poses for a picture with his former athlete father Steve Ovett . Ovett Jnr spent his first seven years in Dumfriesshire, where his parents moved after Steve’s retirement, and where his father competed in the odd cycle race until he collided with a car in 1994 — by coincidence, the year Freddy was born. Freddy knows little about his father’s brief cycling career, and laughs as he says: ‘I can imagine him rocking up, thinking he was stronger than anyone.’ But he knows everything about his running: ‘My depth of knowledge about the history of athletics is more than my dad’s. I have to correct him sometimes on what he did and didn’t do.’ Freddy and his father Steve hit the running track, somewhere Steve is very familiar with . Father and son are cut from the same cloth. ‘We’re so, so close, and so similar,’ he says. That augurs well for Freddy and badly for opponents, since the older Ovett, now 59, was famously competitive. He was equally famously prickly with the press — a trait that doesn’t seem to have been inherited by the genial, open Ovett Jnr. Had social media existed in the 1980s, it’s difficult to imagine Steve asking a journalist to publish his Twitter handle (it’s @freddyovett, since you ask). Freddy recently signed with France’s top development team after swapping running trainers for a bike . Freddy was a promising middle-distance runner, just like his dad, and in 2012 won a scholarship to the University of Oregon. Then he suffered a knee injury. ‘It was so frustrating. I came back to Australia and did a bit of cycling to keep in shape,’ he says. Tests at the Victorian Institute of Sport suggested he had promise. ‘I think I was meant to be a cyclist all along,’ Freddy says. ‘I always followed it, I was always staying up to stupid hours watching the Tour de France. It fascinated me, despite the scandals. I was a big fan of Lance Armstrong before the whole downfall.’ MEDALS: 800m Olympic gold, 1500m bronze (1980); 1500m European gold (1978); 800m European silver (1974, 1978); 5,000m Commonwealth gold (1986). WORLD RECORDS . Ran a 3:48.8 mile in 1980 to beat Seb Coe’s record . Battled with Coe for the mile record in 1981 — it changed hands three times in nine days . Set three 1500m records between 1980 and 1983 . Set a two mile record in 1978 that lasted nine years . Ovett was also BBC Sports Personality of the Year in 1978 . What did his father make of him turning his back on running? ‘When I started cycling, we weren’t speaking,’ says Freddy. ‘It was a strange time, it lasted about a year, which was tough on both of us.’ His parents are divorced and while his mother is still in Noosa, Queensland, his father lives down in Melbourne with his new partner. ‘When I went to Europe last year, my dad and I got back in contact,’ Freddy continues. ‘He sees the way athletics is at the moment and he saw how difficult it was for me to break through. ‘He’s super supportive about my cycling — and excited more than anything. When I speak to him I can sense that.’ Freddy has a lot to live up to if he wants similar levels of success as his father Steve . One of the challenges in athletics, says Ovett Jnr, is dealing with doping, which — surprisingly — he thinks is worse in his original sport than in his new one. ‘Cycling has taken more of an aggressive approach in trying to stamp it out,’ he claims. ‘In athletics, a lot of dodgy stuff is going on that the general public are not aware of, because they’re not knowledgeable enough.’ Freddy, 21, is based in Chambery in the Alps, in an apartment owned by his new team, AG2R. They are as French as cycling teams come, but manager, Vincent Lavenu, a top rider in the 1980s, was interested in a rider called Ovett. ‘He was a fan of my dad’s,’ says Freddy. Steve Cram and Ovett during the heats of the Men's 1500 metres event at the Summer Olympics in 1984 . He shares an apartment with a French rider and a chef comes in to cook lunch and dinner. The team is paying for French classes — he goes to school for three hours a day. The question of his nationality is unresolved. Enquiries were made about him riding for Scotland at last year’s Commonwealth Games, but he is undecided. ‘I have dual citizenship. I don’t want to rush anything,’ he explains. He is wary of declaring for Britain or Australia when he feels he hasn’t proved himself deserving of a place in either national team. Steve was a 1980 Olympic 800 metres gold medallist and a legend of British sport . ‘I need to learn in Under 23 racing before trying to be a hero,’ he says. ‘But I’m definitely not opposed to representing the UK.’ What does his dad think? ‘I don’t know, he’s good at letting me feel my own way. He’s trying to not put too much pressure on me. Both (British and Australian) set-ups are really good — both have incredibly strong national teams.’ Last year, during his first racing trip to Europe, Ovett stayed with his agent, Baden Cooke, in Monaco, which is also where Froome and his Sky team-mate Richie Porte live. Freddy, 21, is based in Chambery in the Alps, in an apartment owned by his new team, AG2R . ‘It was fantastic,’ says Ovett. ‘I went on quite a few rides with Richie and got on really well with him — he checks up on me. And I rode with Chris, including one ride where he was training for the Vuelta. I learned so much. ‘He is such a nice guy and I read a bit about him — he is like this African Maasai warrior, extremely talented but he couldn’t get a handle on how to race. ‘I don’t compare myself with him but I can relate to that. I feel strong enough to make up for my poor bunch racing skills, but I know I’ve got so much to learn.’ Freddy was a promising middle-distance runner and in 2012 won a scholarship to the University of Oregon .","Freddy Ovett is the son of 1980 Olympic 800 metres gold medallist Steve .

"(CNN)For decades, no one has been able to convict millionaire Robert Durst. Not after his wife's disappearance. Not after his friend's suspicious death. Not even after he admitted he killed and dismembered his neighbor. But it may be Durst who does himself in with 11 words he muttered in a restroom: . ""What the hell did I do? Killed them all, of course."" Those comments were picked up on a microphone he was wearing for the HBO documentary series about him called ""The Jinx."" Apparently, the real estate heir didn't turn his microphone off when he went to the bathroom. Durst now sits in a New Orleans jail after his arrest Saturday in connection with the 2000 death of his longtime friend Susan Berman in Los Angeles. On Monday, California prosecutors said Durst was ""lying in wait"" when he shot and killed Berman because she ""was a witness to a crime."" She had been shot in the head shortly before investigators were supposed to come ask her about the disappearance of Durst's first wife in 1982. Durst will be transferred to Los Angeles to face a first-degree murder charge. If convicted, he could face the death penalty. When he goes to trial, could those 11 words be admitted in court? Here, several legal experts weigh in: . Yes: . His lawyer could argue that he absolutely did. ""Here's what his attorneys are going to say: They are going to say that he had an expectation of privacy,"" HLN legal analyst Joey Jackson said. ""And as a result of that, putting this in context, he excused himself and went into a private bathroom."" No: . That argument might not fly, CNN legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin said. ""That whole theory of the Constitution is that you have an expectation of privacy under certain circumstances when you're dealing with the police. But here, he's dealing with filmmakers."" Furthermore, Toobin said, Durst had a microphone on. ""You can't have an expectation of privacy when you're wearing a microphone. Yeah, he maybe forgot, but that's not good enough."" Yes: . The defense very well could, said Jackson, the HLN analyst. ""The attorneys are going to further argue that there was governmental action in as much as HBO was working very closely with the authorities. And they're going to say, isn't it coincidental how his arrest comes on the heels of the final episode of this HBO documentary?"" No: . CNN legal analyst Paul Callan doesn't think that defense will work. ""In criminal law, the police can't wire somebody up. They have to give you Miranda warnings if they're going to take a statement from you,"" he said. ""However, if a civilian is tape-recording you, as was the case here with HBO, that's admissible in court if it's relevant to the crime committed."" Yes: . He could. Susan Criss was the judge during Durst's 2003 murder trial in which he admitted to shooting an elderly neighbor and then dismembering him. She remembers how prosecutors didn't use many of his admissions. ""In our trial, he had been recorded on the phone talking to his wife and friends, making a lot of admissions, and the state never used that,"" she said. ""But he was aware that he had been recorded saying things that could implicate him in the murder that we were trying."" No: . Probably not. Section 1220 of the California Penal Code says ""evidence of a statement is not made inadmissible by the hearsay rule when offered against the declarant in an action to which he is a party in either his individual or representative capacity."" In this case, Durst is the declarant who spoke those words, and if they're used against him, they could be fair game. Yes: . It's a card the defense could certainly play. ""It will be up to (defense attorney) Dick DeGuerin to talk about, and I think he's going to have a field day with the idea that it wasn't an answer in response to a question, (so) that's meaningless,"" CNN legal analyst Mark Geragos said. Already, one of Durst's attorneys has said not to read too much into his client's offhand remarks. ""Your honesty would lead you to say you've said things under your breath before that you probably didn't mean,"" attorney Chip Lewis told Fox News' ""Justice With Judge Jeanine."" ""We want to contest the basis for his arrest, because I think it's not based on facts, it's based on ratings,"" DeGuerin told reporters Tuesday in New Orleans. ""So we will continue to fight for Bob. We want to get to California as quickly as we can so we can get into a court of law and try this case where it needs to be tried."" No: . The prosecution could argue Durst knew what was going on. ""Earlier in those interviews, in a previous interview for that very program, there was a break where he was caught practicing his testimony. And so he realized ... he had a mic on,"" said Criss, the judge from Durst's earlier trial. ""This is a third time he's made that mistake. That's amazing."" CNN's Catherine E. Shoichet contributed to this report.","Real estate heir Robert Durst has been investigated in two deaths and a disappearance . A microphone catches Durst saying he ""killed them all"" Legal experts debate whether that audio can be used against him in court .",8a7e966426724c98b7a482b2ac4749dcaff4ef83
"Three crew members have safely returned to Earth after spending 167 days on the International Space Station. They returned in a Soyuz capsule, landing southeast of the town of Zhezkazgan in Kazakhstan at 2.07am GMT (8.07am local time) this morning. One the ISS three crew members remain, and another three will join on 27 March - including two who will become the first to spend a year continuously on the station. Scroll down for video . What a view: Three astronauts have returned from the ISS after a six-month stay aboard the orbiting space station. The Soyuz TMA-14M (shown) took slightly more than three hours to return after leaving the ISS. This stunning image was taken from a helicopter as the capsule parachuted back to the ground by Nasa photographer Bill Ingalls . This landing brought to an end Expedition 42, carrying with it commander Barry Wilmore of Nasa and flight engineers Alexander Samokutyaev and Elena Serova of the Russian Federal Space Agency (Roscosmos). Serova was the first Russian female cosmonaut to work on the station in two decades . Construction of the ISS began on 20 November 1998. It supports a crew of up to six, with crews split into groups of three. The station orbits at a height of about 255 miles (410km). It has a total mass of about 990,000 pounds (450,000kg) and has living space roughly equivalent to a five-bedroom house. It completes an orbit of Earth every 92.91 minutes and moves at 17,100 miles (27,600km) per hour. It has now been in space for more than 5,900 days, during which time it has completed more than 92,000 orbits of Earth, and has been continuously occupied for more than 13 years. The Soyuz TMA-14M spacecraft, which brought them back to Earth, departed from the space station at 10.44pm GMT on Wednesday. It took them just over three hours to return. 'We wish you a good flight and a soft landing,' the remaining crew on the ISS said to the departing crew. After a few hours of free flight, the Soyuz burned its engine for four minutes and 41 seconds, reducing its velocity enough for it to plummet through the atmosphere, with the crew module separating from the other superfluous sections. Once through the atmosphere, a parachute deployed and brought the Soyuz to a relatively gentle - but still quite bumpy - landing on the ground. Extracted from the capsule, which was charred on re-entry, the three were seated in semi-reclined chairs for a breath of fresh air and first medical checks, bundled up in blankets to protect them from frigid temperatures. 'Everything is great, thank you. The guys are great and worked very well,' said a smiling Serova while a female doctor measured her pulse and blood pressure. 'Congratulations on the recent holiday,' a rescue and recovery team officer said to Serova, referring to the International Women's Day marked on 8 March. 'Everything is fine. I am drinking real tea with lemon,' Samokutyaev said with a smile. 'I am glad to be here,' Wilmore said in Russian before the three got into all-terrain vehicles and were taken to individual helicopters to be evacuated from the landing area.

I am drinking real tea with lemon,' Samokutyaev, pictured, said with a smile after the landing . While on the station, the crew participated in a variety of research focusing on the effects of microgravity on cells, Earth observation, physical science and biological and molecular science. One of several key research focus areas during Expedition 42 was human health management for long-duration space travel, as Nasa and Roscosmos prepare for two crew members to spend one year aboard the space station. On 27 March, Nasa astronaut Scott Kelly and Roscosmos cosmonaut Mikhail Kornienko will undertake the first year-long stay aboard the International Space Station, to prepare astronauts for long-duration missions to Mars. The mission is designed to see how astronauts cope with such a prolonged stay in space - previously, crews only spent a maximum of six months aboard the station before returning to Earth. Expedition 42 also tested the Cloud-Aerosol Transport System (CATS), which provides data to improve scientists' understanding of the structure and evolution of Earth's atmosphere. This may lead to enhancements to spacecraft launches, landings and communications systems; help guide future atmospheric investigations of Mars, Jupiter or other worlds; and help researchers model and predict climate changes on Earth. The station crew also welcomed three cargo spacecraft with several tons of scientific investigations, food, fuel and other supplies.

Pictured from left to right in this photo of the entire Expedition 42 crew are Yelena Serova, Barry Wilmore, Alexander Samokutyaev, Anton Shkaplerov, Terry Virts and Samantha Cristoforetti . In January, the trio helped grapple and connect a SpaceX Dragon spacecraft on the company's fifth contracted commercial resupply mission to the station. The Dragon returned to Earth in February with critical science samples. Two Russian ISS Progress cargo craft docked to the station in October and February, while the fifth and final European Automated Transfer Vehicle (ATV), bearing the name of Belgian physicist Georges Lemaître, considered the father of the Big-Bang theory, departed the station in February. During his time on the orbital complex, Wilmore ventured outside the space station with Nasa astronaut Terry Virts on three spacewalks to prepare for new international docking adapters and future US commercial crew spacecraft. Wilmore also completed a spacewalk in October with fellow Nasa astronaut Reid Wiseman to replace a failed voltage regulator. Samokutyaev conducted one spacewalk during his time in space. During his time on the orbital complex, Wilmore ventured outside the space station (pictured) with Nasa astronaut Terry Virts on three spacewalks to prepare for new international docking adapters and future US commercial crew spacecraft . Having completed his second space station mission, Samokutyaev now has spent 331 days in space. Wilmore, having previously flown as a shuttle pilot on STS-129, has spent 178 days in space. Serova spent 167 days in space on this, her first flight. Expedition 43 currently is operating the station, with Virts in command. Flight engineers Anton Shkaplerov of Roscosmos and Samantha Cristoforetti of Esa are continuing station research and operations until their three new crewmates arrive in two weeks.

"Baghdad (CNN)About 75% of the besieged Iraqi city of Tikrit is now back in government control, the head of a key paramilitary force taking part in the attack told CNN on Thursday. The other 25% is in the hands of about 150 ISIS fighters who continue to hold out, said Main Al-Kadhimi, commander of the Hashd Al-Shaabi militia. There has been no independent confirmation of such a significant advance by the Iraqi forces. But they have been making progress in recent days. ISIS' spokesman, Abu Mohammed al Adnani, called reports of coalition-member victories ""delusional and fake."" He spoke of the coalition's use of fighter jets, heavy artillery and tanks, saying it is a ""nightmare and will go eventually."" On Wednesday, joint Iraqi forces gained control of Tikrit Military Hospital, a few blocks south of the presidential palace. It's part of their ongoing quest to wrest control from ISIS, which captured the city last year. The predominantly Shiite militia has been working with Iraqi troops as well as Sunni fighters to try to regain Tikrit. Tikrit, best known to Westerners as the birthplace of former Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein, fell in June to ISIS, which has captured large areas of Iraq and Syria for what it says is its Islamic caliphate. On March 1, Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi ordered Iraqi forces to retake Tikrit and Salaheddin province. ISIS wasn't making it easy, however. The Sunni extremist group blew up a key bridge near Tikrit, preventing the joint Iraqi forces from using it to cross the Tigris River to approach the city from the east. Nevertheless, forces have made progress, forcing ISIS fighters to retreat toward the city center from front-line positions, Hashd Al-Shaabi's media office said. There have been several failed attempts to recapture Tikrit since the second half of 2014. If Iraq regains control of the city, it could mean that retaking Mosul -- a city 10 times bigger -- is possible. The Tikrit offensive involves around 30,000 fighters. Also assisting is Iran, which has provided advisers, weapons and ammunition to the Iraqi government. According to the Pentagon, Iranians may be operating heavy artillery and rocket launchers as well. Gen. Martin Dempsey, chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff, told a hearing of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on Wednesday that the consensus was that Iran's involvement was positive in military terms. ""Anything anyone does to counter ISIS is in the main a good outcome,"" he said. But Dempsey also voiced concern over what might happen after ISIS is defeated. A key question, he said, is ""whether the government of Iraq will remain on a path to provide an inclusive government for all of the groups"" in Iraq. Tikrit could act as an important testing ground, with some observers concerned that if the predominantly Shiite militias seize control, thanks in part to the support of majority-Shiite Iran, they could carry out reprisal attacks against the remaining Sunni population there. Such attacks could inflame already simmering sectarian tensions within Iraq and make future efforts to retake Mosul and bring peace to the country yet more difficult. In a possible sign of the problems to come, a number of posts on social media appear to show Iraqi soldiers in extremely graphic ""selfies"" with the heads of alleged ISIS militants, or striking odd poses with bodies behind them. Most of the photos are thought to have been taken during the Iraqi military offensive to retake Tikrit  and other areas in Salaheddin province, which started 10 days ago. Two senior security officials in Samarra told CNN, on condition of anonymity because they are not authorized to speak to media, that they are looking into these claims and they are also investigating similar incidents. They did not confirm or deny the authenticity of the images. Anthony Cordesman, a security expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said sectarian division was an issue to be ""extremely concerned"" about as Iraqi forces gain ground in Tikrit. ""It's already been very clear to Iraqis that this is an Iranian-led operation and not one which has the support of the coalition,"" he said. As some Iraqis question why the United States has not taken more decisive action, he said, ""this may be a case where Iran may be gaining very serious influence."" If there are reprisals in Tikrit and it becomes a ""Shiite-on-Sunni struggle,"" Cordesman said, then not only will Iran's influence increase ""but you can see the country divide and Islamic State (ISIS) be replaced by a conflict between Iraqi Shiite and Sunni."" Strong leadership will be needed from the government in Baghdad, headed by al-Abadi, militia leaders and senior religious figures to prevent this outcome, he said, with a lot already being done on this front. The top Iraqi Shiite cleric, Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani, he said, ""very clearly says that Iraqis must act as Iraqis, not divide along sectarian lines."" The challenge will be ensuring that fighters on the ground, some angered by the killings of their relatives by ISIS, do not seek vengeance against Sunni communities whom they suspect of supporting the group. While Iraqi forces piled the pressure on ISIS in Tikrit, the Sunni extremist group continued to flex its muscles in Iraq's western Anbar province, where it is finding a support base among the predominantly Sunni population. More than 40 Iraqi soldiers were killed when ISIS blew up the Iraqi army headquarters just outside Ramadi, an Anbar provincial leader told CNN on Thursday. Militants dug a tunnel and detonated hundreds of homemade explosives, said Sabah Al-Karhout, head of the Anbar Provincial Council. ISIS launched a new offensive on Ramadi, west of Baghdad, on Wednesday morning, Faleh al-Issawi, the deputy head of the council, said in a statement. The city is being attacked ""from all directions,"" with ISIS firing more than 150 mortar rounds and rockets, he said, and explosives-laden vehicles used to attack security checkpoints and a bridge. Officials believe ""this is an ISIS response to the Tikrit operation that is ongoing in the north,"" al-Issawi said. U.S.-led coalition forces carried out 13 airstrikes in Iraq between Wednesday and Thursday morning, a statement said. Five hit ISIS targets near Kirkuk, and three struck ISIS units and a vehicle near Falluja. Elsewhere in Anbar province, Iraqi security forces have managed to wrest back most of the town of Karma, near Falluja, from ISIS, said Sabah Al-Karhout, the head of the Anbar Provincial Council, on Wednesday. Iraqi security forces were fighting side by side with Shiite Hashd Al-Shaabi units and local tribesmen, Al-Karhout said. ISIS is also battling in many places far from Tikrit, including Syria, where the militant group is more on the offensive, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a London-based monitoring group. Clashes continued Thursday between the Kurdish People's Protection Units, or Kurdish YPG, and ISIS fighters in Ras al Ayn, a Syrian strategic border town with Turkey, the Syrian Observatory  said in a statement. Hundreds of ISIS militants launched a large-scale offensive Wednesday in the town, the group said. Dozens have been killed from both sides.

"A woman who ate live frogs as a child had to have an 8cm-long parasite removed from her brain. Yin Meng, 29, had been complaining of headaches for six years when she keeled over at work. She was rushed into hospital in Zhaoyang County in south-western China's Yunnan Province. There, doctors discovered something growing inside her brain. Scroll down for video . Unaware: Yin Meng, 29, had an 8cm-long parasite growing inside her brain, which caused her to collapse . But they had no idea what it was or how to remove it so she was discharged. Yin then took medications to try and control the increasing number of headaches and seizures she was experiencing - before collapsing again. Her boyfriend Shan Tu, 30, said: 'I was getting increasingly worried about her as her fits and seizures were getting worse - and so too were her headaches. 'So when she collapsed again that was the last straw.' Yin was admitted to hospital and this time surgeons agreed to operate - despite the risk. During surgery, they removed the thin, 10cm-long white parasite. A hospital spokesman said: 'The woman was found to be suffering from a parasitic infection called Sparaganosis which had been growing inside her for years. 'It was attacking her nervous system.' Sparaganosis can be contracted by drinking contaminated water, or eating a carrier of the infection such as a frog or a snake. Danger: During surgery,  doctors removed the thin, 8cm-long white parasite (pictured). A hospital spokesman said: 'The woman was found to be suffering from a parasitic infection called sparaganosis' Harm: The parasite (pictured) was attacking Yin's nervous system, triggering seizures and headaches . It can also be transmitted through coming into contact with an open wound from the host. It most commonly affects the brain or the eye. Upon waking and being told about her condition, the patient immediately realised what had happened. 'She said that when she was a child, around five-years-old, she used to catch and eat live frogs with her grandmother, which must be how she contracted the parasitic infection,' the spokeswoman said. 'She said she could remember the feeling of the frog 'jumping' as it went down her throat. She added: 'The damage to her nervous system is quite extensive but we hope we can prevent it from being permanent as the brain has an amazing capacity to heal itself.'","Yin Meng had been complaining of headaches for years before collapsing . 29-year-old had also suffered frequent seizures but it was not clear why .

"First-time parents Kate and David Ogg were heartbroken when they were told one of their twins - born two minutes apart at just 26 weeks - had stopped breathing and had just moments to live. Thinking it was the only time they would have with the tiny boy they had already decided to name Jamie, Kate asked to be able to hold the lifeless child, and told David to climb into the hospital bed for a tender embrace. What happened next was nothing short of a miracle. Scroll down for video . When Kate and David Ogg were told their newborn son Jamie had passed away on March 25, 2010, they took him in their arms and cradled him to keep him warm . Jamie and Emily are now about to turn five years old and their parents have only recently told them of the miraculous story . In this mother's loving arms, the little boy started moving, and his breathing grew stronger. Hospital staff rushed back to his aid and together brought the baby back to life. Five years on, Jamie Ogg is a healthy, happy kid whose biggest problem regarding his troubled entry in the world is having a little brother who tells anyone who'll listen that he used to be dead but now he's alive. After years of trying to fall pregnant, the Queensland couple were delighted to find out they were having twins - the 'pigeon pair' of a boy and girl. But just six months into the pregnancy they found themselves in the delivery room and facing premature births. Jamie was born first on March 25, 2010 and his sister Emily followed two minutes later. 'They were both born in their sac but Jamie didn't make a noise when they tore it open. Emily let out a big wail,' Ms Ogg told Daily Mail Australia. 'We looked over and everyone was crowding around Jamie - there was about 20 people in the room. The vibe wasn't very good. When they were told the devastating news, Kate ordered her husband to take off his shirt and get into the bed to provide extra warmth - and miraculously he gasped for air and opened his eyes . Doctors worked on Jamie for 20 minutes before they stopped and informed his heartbroken parents . The doctor sat on the end of Ms Ogg's hospital bed and asked the couple if they had a name picked out . After birth, skin-to-skin contact is recognised as a simple step mothers can take to welcome their baby into the world. For Kate and David Ogg the point is all the more pertinent. The birth process is a stressful and exhausting time for the baby. Unicef advises mothers to hold their child in skin-to-skin contact to help their baby 'adapt to their new environment'. It means their 'heartbeat and breathing will be better controlled' and there is a wealth of evidence that suggests babies held in skin-to-skin contact are less stressed by the birth process. Unicef's advice states: 'We know that babies who have spent an hour in skin contact are significantly less stressed after the birth experience - this means their breathing and heart rate are more stable, they cry less, and when they start to feed, they digest their food better. 'A mother's chest area is significantly warmer than other parts of her body - ready to welcome her new baby and prevent them from cooling down - which is a significant risk. 'Your baby has been lovely and warm in your uterus - at around 37 degrees, whereas the labour room will be significantly cooler, and he is wet – it’s like getting out of the swimming baths, you need to get dry and warm quickly.' Meanwhile Caroline Davey, chief executive of the premature baby charity, Bliss, echoed the importance of skin-to-skin contact. She said it is 'an essential part of family-centred care and should be part of the care that all babies receive'. Ms Davey added: 'Evidence shows that it can help to regulate the baby’s heartbeat, lower their stress levels and can play an important role in improving the positive outcomes for premature babies.’ 'He stopped breathing and his heartbeat was nearly gone. After 20 minutes they stopped working on him.' The doctor sat on the end of Ms Ogg's hospital bed and asked the couple if they had a name picked out. He then informed them that there was nothing more they could do to save Jamie. 'I saw him gasp but the doctor said it was no use. I took Jamie off the doctor, asked everyone to leave. He was cold and I just wanted him to be warm,' she said. 'We had tried for years to have kids and I felt so guilty. I just wanted to cuddle him. I unwrapped him and ordered my husband to take his shirt off and climb into the bed. 'I know it sounds stupid, but if he was still gasping there was still a sign of life so I wasn't going to give up easily. 'I know it sounds stupid, but if he was still gasping there was still a sign of life so I wasn't going to give up easily,' Mrs Ogg said . 'We were trying to entice him to stay. We explained his name and that he had a twin that he had to look out for and how hard we tried to have him,' Mrs Ogg said . 'He suddenly gasped... then he opened his eyes. He was breathing and grabbing Dave's finger,' Mrs Ogg said . 'We were trying to entice him to stay. We explained his name and that he had a twin that he had to look out for and how hard we tried to have him. 'He suddenly gasped... then he opened his eyes. He was breathing and grabbing Dave's finger. 'If we had let the doctor walk out of the room with him, Jamie would have been dead.' Jamie and Emily are now about to turn five years old and their parents have only recently told them of the miraculous story. 'Emily burst into tears, she was really upset and she kept hugging Jamie,' Ms Ogg said. 'They love to talk about when they were babies. 'They have a little brother Charlie who loves telling anyone who listens. He'll say: ""When I was born I was fat and the twins were skinny. Jamie was also dead but now he is alive"".' Emily and Jamie also have a little brother Charlie, 4, and regularly talk about their miracle birth story . Remarkably, Jamie has not encountered one medical problem in the five years since his birth . When the twins were first told of their miracle birth, Emily burst into tears and wouldn't stop hugging Jamie . The Ogg family have set up an online community called Jamie's Gift to regularly raise funds for the Miracle Babies Foundation - an organisation that supports premature and sick newborns . Remarkably, Jamie has not encountered one medical problem in the five years since his birth. 'He is absolutely fine... the biggest concern they had was cerebral palsy because of the lack of oxygen but there's been nothing,' Ms Ogg said. 'It's absolutely astounding. This whole experience makes you cherish them more.' The Ogg family have set up an online community called Jamie's Gift to regularly raise funds for the Miracle Babies Foundation - an organisation that supports premature and sick newborns. Dave is currently training for an Ironman triathlon in Port Macquarie in May to raise funds. 'He will put his body through a gruelling 3.8km swim, 180km bike and a marathon,' Ms Ogg said.

"The 16-year-old girl who survived a deadly axe-attack that claimed the lives of three family members has been released from hospital after suffering severe brain damage and a severed jugular. Marli van Breda has been transferred to a rehabilitation clinic after leaving Vergelegen Medi-Clinic in Somerset West, just outside of Cape Town, on Tuesday, News24 reports. The former Perth schoolgirl has been in hospital since she was struck several times on the head and had her throat slashed in her family's South African home on January 27. Scroll down for video . Marli van Breda, 16, suffered severe brain damage when she was struck several times on the head in her family's South African home in January . Henri van Breda (back left) escaped the attack while his father Martin, 55 (back right), mother Teresa, 54 (front right), and brother Rudi, 22 (back centre) were killed. Marli, 16 (front left), suffered severe head and throat injuries . The attack claimed the lives of her mother Teresa, 54, father Martin, 55, and older brother Rudi, 22. Marli's other brother Henri, 20, escaped with light injuries and rang police to report the deaths at the Stellenbosch home, east of Cape Town. Family spokesman Martin Coetzee said Marli will undergo occupational and physical therapy at the rehabilitation clinic after six weeks in hospital. While her health has improved, Marli has not yet been able to make a complete police statement regarding the attack. She has been able to talk despite her injuries, but not for long periods. The family have not revealed the rehabilitation centre where Marli will be treated so her recovery can go ahead without disruptions. Chilling: An audio recording between Henri (right, pictured with brother Rudi) and emergency services after his family were hacked to death with an axe, revealed the 20-year-old appeared to giggle during the call . Marli was transferred to a rehabilitation clinic on Tuesday after spending six weeks at Vergelegen Medi-Clinic in Somerset West, just outside of Cape Town . It comes after reports last month that visitors had been banned from visiting the teenager's hospital room in a bid to keep her surviving brother away. 'They fear she might go into shock, or will be traumatised further if she sees him,' a source told  The Sunday Times newspaper. Marli has reportedly been crying when she sees photos of her parents and brother. 'It is heartbreaking to see tears rolling down her cheeks,' a person close to the family said. It emerged last month that an audio recording of the emergency phone call made by Henri, obtained by eNews Channel Africa, seems to reveal him 'giggling' as he explains the details of the bloody massacre. 'What kind of injuries are there?' a woman can be heard asking Henri, who responds: 'my family and me were attacked by a guy with an axe.' When asked if they were unconscious, he responded, 'yes, and bleeding from the head', before what sounds like a faint chuckle is heard. A cleaner who worked for one of the van Breda's neighbours saw the young man, covered in blood, using his phone outside the house shortly after the attack. Deceased: Martin (left) and wife Theresa (right) both died at their home in Stellenbosch -  east of Cape Town . Rudi (pictured left and right) has been remembered by friends as a keen sportsman. His younger brother Henri is currently living with his uncle Her after suffering light injuries . The van Breda family had just moved back to South Africa in June after six years in Perth, Western Australia . The young man's mental health has been under scrutiny since News24 reported he had undergone brain scans at an Australian hospital in 2014. However the results were negative and no further testing occurred. A doctor who examined the young man following the attack revealed his injuries were self-inflicted. He was also reportedly addicted to tik and his allowance was cut off before his family were attacked. Henri has been living with his uncle, Her Breda, since the attack and has been receiving counselling. His uncle denied rumours the police wanted to keep him away from a private memorial service held for his deceased family - insisting he was simply being hidden from the media's gaze. Popular: Rudi Van Breda was popular with his friends at Trinity College and the University of Melbourne . Separated siblings: Rudi (left) was killed during the attack, while Marli (right) remains in a critical but stable condition in a South African hospital . A close family friend described the van Breda's as 'like a perfect family' 'For obvious reasons Henri is very heartbroken, and we will support him as the family,' he was quoted in The Times. 'We as a family are here for him, we will not disappoint him... I promise Henri I won't drop him.' No one has been charged over the attack on the family and Marli has a round-the-clock police guard.

"The British are happier than the French but more miserable than the Irish, an EU league table of happiness revealed yesterday. It found that we are on a par with the Germans when we measure our satisfaction with life, and much more cheerful than those worst hit by the euro crisis, including Spain, Italy, Portugal and Greece. Scandinavian countries ranked happiest, according to the table compiled by Eurostat, the EU’s statistics arm. The British are happier than the French but more miserable than the Irish, an EU league table of happiness revealed yesterday . It was put out to mark today’s International Day of Happiness established by the UN and was based on answers to the question: ‘Overall, how satisfied are you with your life these days?’ Britons scored 7.3 out of ten – compared to a European average of 7.1 – but the Danes, Finns and Swedes all recorded an average satisfaction level of eight. In Britain, the results of the surveys have shown that married people are happier than cohabitees or single people; that young people and the newly retired are happier than the squeezed middle-aged; and that we worry more about our health than most of the rest of the EU. They have also suggested that better-off people are happier than those who are poor. Ireland scored 7.4 to just pip Britain while the people of economically stagnant France rated seven. The Mediterranean countries came even lower, while Bulgarians were bottom of the table, recording a miserable 4.8. The happiness league follows the introduction by Brussels of life satisfaction surveys which are carried out by national statistics ministries across the continent. Britain has been measuring the happiness of the population since 2010, when David Cameron backed the idea, saying it was as important to know about people’s well-being as to publish economic figures. The British surveys are costing taxpayers £2 million a year. Eurostat said yesterday: ‘Life satisfaction is a multi-dimensional concept, which is very much shaped by various socio-demographic factors which lead to different living situations as well as to different expectations and preferences.’ It said that broadly men and women were equally happy, and health was more important to people than money, work or friends.",British are happier than the French according to an EU table of happiness .

"An Episcopal minister at one of New York City's most iconic churches has been arrested after she allegedly swerved through lanes while intoxicated, and was found with an open container of alcohol and hundreds of prescription pills. Diane Reiners, 53, was taken into custody on March 13 after witnesses alerted police that her orange Toyota struck the Holland Tunnel's curb around 6pm and stopped in the middle of the road. Reiners was charged with driving while intoxicated, possession of a controlled substance in a motor vehicle, disobeying traffic and reckless driving, police said on Saturday, according to CBS.

She explained: 'What we try to do at Goop is curate and to edit.

'We aren't a super-luxury site, but we're aspirational. We have things on there that cost $4. We have things on there that cost $500. Sometimes I think that some of the criticism Goop gets is because people haven’t actually gone to the site and looked around and seen what we actually are.' In 2011, the star admitted that the near-deafening criticism she faced over Goop prompted her to consider quitting the brand altogether. 'There were a couple of times when I thought, ""I'm just gonna stop doing it. People are so mean to me. I don't want to do it,""' she told Harper's Bazaar UK. 'But then I was like, ""Who cares what some lame person out there says?"" I was in Italy once, and this old man came up to me and said, ""I had the best time in Nashville because of Goop.""

"Mickey Mouse and Donald Duck are facing an uphill battle in the Orlando popularity stakes this weekend. Disney World is a real life Magic Kingdom for millions yet not even the grandest of shows or white knuckle rides will match the atmosphere in the creaking, cavernous Citrus Bowl on Sunday afternoon. A sell-out crowd of 62,000 will make their way downtown to witness Orlando City, led out by Brazilian legend Kaka, in their inaugural MLS match against another fellow newcomer in the shape of NYCFC. David Villa is expected to make his MLS debut against Orlando City FC on Sunday for New York City . Brazilian star Kaka will also play in the match on Sunday, for the new MLS franchise Orlando City . The match will take place at Florida's Citrus Bowl, which was a venue at the 1994 USA World Cup . It’s an opening day fixture to get the marketing men salivating. Yet while the newfangled New York franchise have literally started from scratch, this match, shown live on Sky Sports in the UK, marks the culmination of four years of hard work and realised dreams. Adrian Heath, the former England Under 21 and Everton midfielder, has been in charge all of that time , thanks in no small part to a chance meeting in a Newcastle-under-Lyme pub with a bloke called Phil Rawlins. Rawlins, a director at Stoke City who founded a highly successful IT sales and marketing consulting company in Texas, has lived in the US for 17 years and was desperate to make his mark in a football scene he could see growing before his very eyes. Heath was keen too. Former Everton midfielder Adrian Heath has guided Orlando City to MLS after four years of hard work . Heath's appointment came after a chance meeting with Phil Rawlins (right), who was desperate to make his mark in a football scene he could see growing before his very eyes . Out of work after not having a caretaker stint at Coventry City turn into a permanent role , the 54 year-old had already witnessed what effect the beautiful game was having in the US during a pre-season tour which took him to the fanatical footballing hotbed of Portland. The possibilities fascinated him. Initially the pair, introduced to each other by agent Gary Mellor, went to Texas where Rawlins founded the Austin Aztecs. At this point, leaving the USL Pro, the third tier of the American soccer scene, and joining MLS was more than a pipedream. So Rawlins upped sticks and relocated everyone to Florida. And Orlando City were born. Orlando City tweeted this about how Lampard won't be at the game and wrote: 'Sorry, Frank - we're sold out' A first championship was secured in their inaugural season and, impressively, a fan base in a state which has enjoyed its fair share of disappointments following the folding of MLS side Miami Fusion in 2002 (Fusion were based in Fort Lauderdale, a good 200 miles away), the Orlando natives got straight behind the Lions. Another regular season title and a second championship followed. That has ensured that Heath has achieved a rare feat – taking a team up through the levels in a country where promotion and relegation are dirty words. Unlike New York City, there is a strong feeling of continuity allied with a natural connection to the city. Eight players remain the squad from their final USL Pro season. NYCFC manager Jason Kreis will lead his team out for their first ever MLS match on Sunday . NYCFC will begin in front of a 62,000 sell-out crowd against Orlando City at Citrus Bowl in Florida . Yet not everything came easily. Behind the scenes, Rawlins was working tirelessly. He desperately wanted to take the club on to the highest level. That, however, needs more than sweat and toil on the pitch. With top level franchise costs rocketing from $7.5 to $100 million, big bucks are needed to take a seat at the top table. They were snubbed by MLS in 2012. Enter Brazilian millionaire Flavio Augusto da Silva in February 2013. Having made his money in setting up English language schools back home, his arrival has been key. He provides the conduit between South America and the US, a partnership which satisfies many people on myriad levels. Naturally, his wealth and business expertise have ensured Orlando City’s dream has become a striking reality. His links into the South American market, where so much talent bubbles under the surface, have been crucial – Columbia, El Salvador and Brazil are all represented in Heath’s squad. Honduran striker Bryan Rochez,19, is the youngest designated player in the League. Seb Hines (top right) has arrived on loan from Middlesbrough and will play for Orlando in their opening game . Sean St Ledger, formerly of Preston and Leicester, is also set to make his MLS bow on Sunday . Former Birmingham City midfielder Lewis Neal ,the loan arrivals of Seb Hines from Middlesbrough and Republic of Ireland international and free agent Sean St Ledger give their English boss a reminder of home and some experience to boot. Most importantly though, Orlando is the No 1 holiday destination for Brazil’s middle classes. So where better to start an Anglo-American-Brazilian franchise? An impressive 20,000 were at a championship match against Charlotte. MLS couldn't deny them again. Their place as the 21st franchise was confirmed nine months after Da Silva's arrival. The prospect of even more tourist dollars flowing into the city has got the club firmly on-side with the local authorities and businesses. New York City have made their mark off the pitch with stellar signings to impress their fanbase . Flavio Augusto da Silva (left) has been key to the progress of Orlando City since his arrival in February 2013 . Unlike in Miami when it comes to David Beckham, they are right behind his plans, so much so that, after agreeing a public and private partnership plan, a brand spanking new 19,500 stadium could be ready for the start of next season. Walt Disney World Resort are one of the founding sponsors. Oh, and he is friends with Kaka. When Da Silva came calling, the 32 year-old former world footballer of the year didn’t have to think twice. The $7.2 million salary - making him the best paid player in the League - certainly helped. His fanfare arrival piqued interest like never before. Kaka is the man Heath is building his team and vision around. Injuries over the years may have taken their toll yet he still managed 56 games last term for AC Milan and Sao Paulo. The kind of touch and awareness which saw him join Real Madrid for an eye watering £57 million in 2009 will be there for all to see. Da Silva and Rawlins’ business plan has been ticking all the boxes so it will be fascinating to see how Heath adapts to MLS and the injection of quality he will encounter week in, week out. Only two expansion teams have reached the end of season playoffs in their debut campaign, so history is not on Orlando’s side. The chairman has already stated that his men have to make sure they’re the third. The pressure is on without a ball being kicked. Yet with such brilliant support in the stands, the city and the boardroom, you get the feeling Heath’s men are onto a winner, whatever happens. Kaka - Orlando City SC . The Brazilian won the Ballon d’Or back in 2007, so it is understandable that a lot is expected of him with new MLS franchise Orlando City. He may not be the player he was back in 2007 but he still has the ability to dribble past players and pick a pass. Frank Lampard – New York City FC . One of two high-profile signings made by New York City on their introduction to the league. Lampard won more than 100 caps for England and 11 major trophies with Chelsea in 13 years. He is due in New York in the summer once he has finished playing with Manchester City. Steven Gerrard – LA Galaxy . The Liverpool midfielder will become the second former England captain to join LA Galaxy following the successful period of David Beckham. Like Lampard, Gerrard will not join Galaxy until the summer once the Premier League has finished. He will link up with former Reds team-mate Robbie Keane. David Villa - New York City FC . Villa became New York City’s first marquee signing when he joined after helping Atletico Madrid win La Liga last season. He has spent time on loan at Melbourne City in the Australian A League and he will be expected to score the bulk of New York’s goals in their debut season. Bradley Wright-Phillips - New York Red Bulls . Overshadowed by brother Shaun in England but since moving to MLS he has been the star man for the Red Bulls. He won the Golden Boot last season with 27 goals in 32 games. With the departure of Thierry Henry and Tim Cahill he could struggle to score as many this term.","New York City and Orlando City face each other in their first MLS match . A sell-out crowd of 62,000 will witness the match at Citrus Bowl . The match marks the culmination four years of hard work for Orlando City .

"Tory MPs have criticised the Government for being ‘blind’ to the soaring threats Britain faces and accused it of freeloading off the US. Former Army captain John Baron said yesterday that the UK was ‘ignoring the lessons of history at our peril’ by refusing to commit to spend 2 per cent of national income on defence. He said claims that Britain boasts the world’s fifth largest defence budget ‘rings hollow’ when the Ministry of Defence is slashing manpower and capabilities. Tory MP John Baron, left, urged Prime Minister David Cameron to commit at least two per cent of the  budget to defence spending as US General Raymond Odierno warned over 'unthinkable' cuts to the British Army . The Basildon and Billericay MP said ‘misguided military interventions’ in the last decade, including Iraq and Afghanistan, had distracted the UK from the ‘greater danger of state on state’ threats from countries such as Russia. He added: ‘Failing defence budgets across Nato have emboldened the Russian president, who has concluded that the heart has gone out of the alliance. This is dangerous.’ He called on the Government to spend 3 to 4 per cent of national income on defence, saying it was ‘nonsense’ that on current projections Britain will be spending the same on defence as on foreign aid in 15 years. Referencing comments made by the US chief of staff General Raymond Odierno, he said the idea of British brigades serving within American divisions because of severe cuts to numbers was ‘unthinkable’ only a decade ago. A total of 37 MPs, the majority of whom are Tories, backed a motion in Parliament yesterday to set the defence budget at 2 per cent of national income in law, in a significant challenge to David Cameron just weeks ahead of the election. The motion, headed by Mr Baron, was passed but has no legal force. Rory Stewart, chairman of the defence select committee, waded into the four-hour debate in the Commons, saying that Britain was acting as a ‘freeloader’ to the US. He told MPs: ‘These threats are real. The world is genuinely becoming more dangerous, and Britain cannot be a freeloader. ‘People stand up and list all the different kit that we have bought, but they do not intend ever to use it.’ He added that ‘they’ were ‘freeloading’ by thinking ‘that Britain will never act alone, that the United States will somehow fill in all the gaps’. Mr Baron warned that Britain faced a significant threat from countries such as Russia . He said that if the UK was serious about defence, the Government would need to look at ballistic missiles, upgrading elite units and protecting soldiers against chemical weapons with special suits. A study by the impartial House of Commons library released this week revealed that current plans suggest defence spending will represent only 1.87 per cent of national income next year. Tory MP Simon Reevell described the Prime Minister’s suggestion that intelligence service spending could count towards the 2 per cent target as ‘kindergarten economics’. Tory Jack Lopresti said Iraq and Afghanistan showed ‘what happens when you try and deploy troops abroad on the cheap, without being properly equipped’. Mr Baron agreed: ‘It took the Americans to put in another 20,000 troops before we pulled that situation round. We require armed forces of sufficient capability and capacity to respond to any challenge.’",Tory MPs have warned the government about cuts in defence spending . John Baron MP said Britain was 'ignoring the lessons of history' He said David Cameron should commit to a minimum two per cent spend . MPs said defence spending could come at the expense of foreign aid .,53563cc8e6017464e2d5feb44616d9be43a10cd7
"She has walked for the likes of Chanel and Dolce & Gabbana,  been a Victoria's Secret Angel for five years in a row, and on top of this, is a married woman. So it's no wonder that busy supermodel Lindsay Ellingson needs ways to unwind, just like everyone else. The 30-year-old has now revealed her top tips for managing stress to online beauty magazine, Byrdie, and thankfully they are things that everyone can incorporate into their lifestyle. Scroll down for video . Victoria's Secret Angel for five years, Lindsay Ellingson has revealed her top tips for managing stress . Lindsay Ellingson regularly posts images of her cockapoo Carly and says 'nothing beats' time with her . The model admitted that 'nothing beats quality time with my little pup Carly!' The California-native is regularly pictured with her dog, Carly the cockapoo (a cross between an American Cocker Spaniel and a poodle) on Instagram. Ellingson commented on the feeling of love that she receives from spending time with her pet: 'She's just full of love, as are most pets.' She goes on to suggest alternatives for those who don't own dogs: 'If you don’t or can’t have a pet, many animal shelters love to have volunteers who come to interact with the animals. 'In fact, several shelters [...] let you come and walk the dogs for a few hours a day.' Lindsay also recommends massaging oil into the skin on daily basis, revealing it's the smell that works to de-stress: 'The scents will immediately transport you to a calm place.' Aromatherapy oils are yet another way that the model stays stress-free in her hectic lifestyle . Forget coffee, the model drinks calming organic tea, containing liquorice ginger, cardamon, and cinnamon . She even carries her oils with her, admitting, 'I never leave home without it.' The Victoria's Secret model also says  drinking a special herbal tea when she's on the move or feeling out of sorts can make her feel calm again. In particular, she goes for natural herbal Vata tea, which consists of liquorice root, organic ginger, cardamom and cinnamon. Ellingson further adds that she personally opts for the tea when 'travelling [or] feeling restless.' The 30-year-old emphasises always 'falling asleep the right way' - especially with Carly next to her . 5. Spa day - A midday spa appointment is one of the Victoria Secret Angel's favourite ways to unwind . And for the model, getting her beauty sleep is a must. She opts for a pre-bed ritual to guarantee she'll feel well-rested the next days, explaining that it's important to fall 'asleep the right way'. This involves removing devices from around the bed. She said: 'Reading on my iPad is a big no-no.' Instead, she suggested 'a cup of warm almond milk before bed and then massaging your feet with an essential oil.' The best time to go to sleep? 'Preferably at 10pm - according to Ayurveda, an alternative medicine, originating from India, your body repairs itself most effectively between 10pm and 2am,' she said. While another New Age tip for managing stress is: 'a mid-day Ayurveda facial in between running to my appointments', which she describes as 'the perfect pick-me-up.' And the best bit is the massage. The model's favourite parts to concentrate on are: 'My favorite part is the face, neck, arm, and shoulder massage.' For those who are new to the entire spa experience? 'Bring a friend to enjoy the day,' she advises. For the next tip, Lindsay can't quite put her finger on the reason she finds painting her nails so relaxing. 'Maybe it's the total distraction from all my daily activities and the focus it takes to paint inside the lines.' Lindsay finds that the concentration needed to paint her nails is a relaxing experience . Ayurvedic self-massage - The model has always been interested in alternative medicine and tried out Ayurveda, which aims to balance the body, mind, and spirit through a combination of sleep, yoga, herbs and oils, meditation, and a healthy diet . Another tip from Lindsay: 'I love the idea of giving yourself an oil massage every day.' Earlier this year the model became interested in Ayurveda: an alternative medicine that originated in India. 'I wanted to try something new and good for my body and mind.' Prior to giving the self-massage, the model suggests: '[Rubbing] a couple drops of calming oil into [your] hands for a few seconds... and deep breaths to slowly transition into a meditative state.' Lindsay states that she enjoys an oil massage due to the fact: 'It's incredibly soothing and detoxifying.' Lindsay says that something that everyone can relate to enjoying is a getaway . The beauty pairs a face mask with  under-eye patches, and for the extra relaxation factor, a cup of tea . Lindsay flags going on holiday as 'the ultimate way to recharge' and that listening to the sound of the waves is an incredible relaxation technique. Her low-budget alternative? 'If you can’t afford a seaside getaway, no problem. Thankfully there's an app for that - the soothing sound of crashing waves, no beach required!' And if you'd rather just put your feet up at home, make like the model and slap on a face mask while you're sipping a calming cuppa. Although she admits:'I try not to scare my husband like this too often!'",The 30-year-old model has been a Victoria Secret Angel for five years .

"A Norwegian man could be imprisoned for cutting off his own beard and gluing it to another man's head to create a toupee. He claims the recipient of the home-made hairpiece - who had a restraining order against him - wanted it because he was bald, according to the prosecutor in the case. The man in his 40s is also being tried for a string of other petty crimes including burglary and theft following the alleged attack which took place in Hordaland county on Norway's west coast on Friday. Bad hair day: A Norwegian man in his 40s could be imprisoned for cutting off his own beard and gluing to another man's head (file photo) Harald Bilberg told the Bergens Tidende newspaper: 'He was bald, so the accused claims that they had agreed to create a toupee for the aggrieved party. 'These incidents happened a long way out in the police district, and we therefore believe it is important that those who live there are protected.' 'We are not talking about serious crimes, but it's more of a nuisance. I must admit that I have never encountered such a case in my career.' The man who has already been convicted of seven crimes and fined 13 times was in breach of a restraining order imposed to protect the recipient of the toupee. Hordaland country's remoteness on Norway's west coast makes it very difficult for the police to access quickly during an emergency. Mr Bilberg said the frequency of the man's offences should be judged accordingly so he does not go on to commit new crimes.

"A South Australian man holidaying in Vanuatu reportedly survived on a diet of flying fox and small native birds after bunking down with locals in the aftermath of Cyclone Pam. Three days before the category five cyclone hit 45–year-old Andrew Brooks travelled south to Tanna Island in the hopes he could climb the active Yasur volcano. The thrill seeker got more than he bargained for as the powerful cyclone hit in the early hours of the morning killing 16 people across the nation and demolishing almost everything in its path. Scroll down for video . The category five cyclone ravaged small villages completely wiping out the grass huts the villagers call home . Mr Brooks, along with 60 villagers and a score of tourists, sought refuge in a concrete school building and waited for the howling wind to stop. He sat huddled with the villagers for four or five hours while the cyclone tore through, destroying the grass huts that made up the village. He told The Advertiser the wind was incredibly loud, almost like a ‘freight train or jet plane.’ Mr Brooks waited for aid with around 60 villagers at the foot of Yasur volcano after Cyclone Pam hit . After the winds stopped Mr Brooks soon realised he was stranded and spent the next five days cut off from civilisation at the foot of the volcano. It was at this stage the villagers discovered that all the gardens and cooking houses were destroyed by the sheer force of the winds. He said they managed to find some rice vegetables and chicken which sustained them for a day or two before he was gobsmacked by what he was served next. After running out of food villagers offered Mr Brooks flying fox which he said was nice, but tough . Mr Brooks was in the southern region of Vanuatu when Cyclone Pam hit . He was presented with a cooked flying fox but knowing food was limited Mr Brooks said he was in no position to turn his nose up to warm meat . He said the resourceful villagers fashioned missiles from lengths of wood to strike down unsuspecting birds and bats. “Any time anything flew past, whether it was a finch or a flying fox, there’d be this hail of sticks thrown at it,” he told reporters. “They were getting finches and baby pigeons and eating them. And one morning they got a flying fox, which is quite large, and they cooked it up with rice and gave me a serve and they ate the rest. Villagers fashioned missiles from lengths of wood to strike down unsuspecting small birds and bats . He didn’t complain about his interesting diet and said it was ‘quite tasty’ but tough, likening the flavours to that of chicken. Although he was happy not to be starving he said he had concerns about the villagers health and safety after the cyclone left them with nothing. “There are lots of young babies in the area and they were saying, ‘Our babies are going to die and the old people are going to die’, because it’s so remote and they’re at the end of the road so they’re going to be the last to get aid, probably,” he said. He reported that villagers were having to hike 4 kilometers up mountains to get fresh water. Mr Brooks said villagers were concerned about the large population of young children on the island . Mr Brooks is worried the villagers will have trouble bouncing back from the disaster, adding that he hopes aid reaches the ‘far-flung villages’ like the one that sheltered him. Although no one he was with sustained injuries, people in nearby villages weren’t so lucky with a mother and son perishing after they were struck with debris. Mr Brooks said he intended to return to Vanuatu in the ­future to thank the villagers who sheltered and fed him. These revelations came as Foreign Minister Julie Bishop pledged Australia’s long term support for Vanuatu during a visit to the Pacific nation. 'The Australian government and the Australian people will continue to support you in your time of need' Accompanied by the Chief of the Defence Force, Air Chief Marshal Mark Binskin, she strongly indicated that Australia would make a substantial contribution to the longer term rebuilding of the devastated nation. ""Prime Minister I want to assure you that the Australian government and the Australian people will continue to support you in your time of need, not only in the immediate aftermath of the cyclone, but I know that your long term recovery efforts will take some time."" Ms Bishop arrived Sunday morning to tour the cyclone relief centre in the capital Port Vila. She said Australia has sent over 11 military planes carrying lifesaving supplies and humanitarian support personnel.","Andrew Brooks, 45, was holidaying in Vanuatu when Cyclone Pam hit .

"'Busy': Richard Baker made a 'Max Speed 20mph' sign after police claimed they ‘did not have the resources’ to monitor motorists outside his home . Police told a pensioner that they were too busy to deal with speeders using his road – but turned up within 30 minutes after he put up a DIY warning sign. Officers in Newbury, Berkshire, claimed they ‘did not have the resources’ to monitor motorists outside pensioner Richard Baker’s terraced home. So he made a ‘Max Speed 20mph’ sign and stuck it on the roadside –only to find an officer on his doorstep demanding that he remove the notice half an hour later. Mr Baker, 71, said he and his partner Rosemary Cribb fear someone will be knocked down and killed by the ‘mad’ drivers. ‘No one will do anything about the speeding, but put up an illegal sign and all of a sudden you get the police banging on your door,’ he said. ‘All I want to do is stop people speeding before there’s a tragedy – somebody’s got to do something about it. 'West Berkshire Council says it’s not their fault, and Thames Valley Police told me they haven’t got the time or resources. ‘But they can very soon find the time to send someone round to knock on my front door. ‘I put up the sign and inside 30 minutes an officer was round here telling me to take it down. ‘I’m just so frustrated – has it got to take someone’s death for them to do anything about the speeding traffic?’ 'West Berkshire Council says it’s not their fault, and Thames Valley Police told me they haven’t got the time or resources,' Mr Baker said . Mr Baker’s road was made a 20mph zone in 2010 after repeated requests from worried residents and local councillors. But Mr Baker said signs warning motorists that it is a 20mph limit are not clearly displayed and pointed out that even some of his neighbours are not aware of the speed restrictions. He said: ‘This morning a woman complained to my daughter that it isn’t 20 along this road, it’s 30mph. She came back and said she was totally unaware it was 20mph.’ A police spokesman said they would investigate Mr Baker’s complaints.","Police said they were too busy to monitor drivers in Richard Baker's road .

"(CNN)Football is the most widely played sport among French youths. Yet, it struggles to attract and retain girls. How can football serve as a tool of socialization when it remains the domain of young boys and men? Algeria coach Christian Gourcuff, who has a coached a number of Ligue 1 clubs, notes that for a long time, women's football ""was a sport totally marginalized."" Stereotypes abounded that the sport was too rough, too masculine for girls to play. They were much more likely to compete in basketball, ride horseback, or dance, such as Maïmouna Coulibaly, whose dance company, Les Ambianceuses, is internationally recognized (though overshadowed by her brother, Amedy Coulibaly, the kosher supermarket shooter in the aftermath of the Charlie Hebdo massacre). But change is afoot. Since the late 1980s, the French Football Federation (FFF) has promoted the sport to women and girls. ""Over the past 10 years, there has been a considerable development of the women's game,"" said Gourcuff. Former player and ex-Paris Saint-Germain official Jean-Michel Moutier concurred. Over the past decade ""girls have significantly increased the level of play,"" he said. ""I am agreeably surprised by the quality of certain female football matches."" The sport's increased television presence helps significantly, especially broadcasts of the women's World Cup. ""That has changed a bit the image of women's football,"" Gourcuff said, ""notably among young girls."" Farid El Alagui, who now plays for Scottish club Hibernian, noticed a dramatic difference in how women's football is perceived back home. ""If you look at the French national team,"" he said, ""they've been really good."" Les Bleues are presently third in FIFA's world ranking and hopes are high for their success at the women's World Cup in Canada between June 6 and July 5. The professional women's league is also responsible for encouraging more girls to play. ""There are big clubs like Paris Saint-Germain,"" El Alagui said, ""who are very good and the level of play is quite high."" Such examples foster confidence to try to the sport. ""I think a lot of girls want to play football,"" he said. ""They're just scared."" However, enrollment statistics paint a less exuberant portrait. At ASVCM only seven out of 345 players in the club's football school are girls, and two more play with the club's youth teams in competitions. Such statistics are mirrored nationally. During the 2013-14 season, there were 50,516 licensed girls in the Under-6 to Under-20 demographic, as compared to 997,511 for boys of the same age. While few in number, the young girls at ASVCM -- a local sports club based in a town 12 kilometers south of Paris -- are welcomed and respected, observed Catherine Ledemé, who has volunteered with the club for more than a decade. ""They are often the 'mascots' of the team,"" she said. Moreover, they excel on the field. The football section's president Marc Girard proudly boasted that two of ASVCM's young players are in formation with PSG's women's team. For Ledemé, who week-in and week-out ensures the club's conviviality, ""football has strong social values."" She supports girls playing football, regardless of the game's stereotypes or image, a sentiment indicative of changing or changed attitudes. More is needed, but the continued success of the women's league and national team will perhaps inspire more girls to take up the sport.","French women's football has long been marginalized, stereotyped as a sport that is too rough and masculine for girls to play . In recent years an increased television presence has raised the profile of the game, especially broadcasts of the women's World Cup . Enrollment statistics remain low with only about 50,000 licensed girls under 20 years of age compared to almost 1 million boys .",b67f532c9794cd59eb3726c2e0c065d81239f1a6
"England’s fourth Six Nations runners-up finish in a row has been labelled ‘unacceptable’ by RFU chief executive Ian Ritchie, with head coach Stuart Lancaster told performances must improve before the World Cup. Lancaster’s men suffered heartache as their thrilling 55-35 victory over France on Saturday saw them fall six points short of overhauling Ireland and securing a first title since 2011. But Ritchie said: ‘Four years as runners-up is not acceptable and we are not happy with how that came about. We should be winning more in terms of Grand Slams, Six Nations championships, other things. England are left reeling on the pitch as their 55-35 victory against France failed to secure the title .

The Irish deserved the win because of what they did over the five matches. We did not do enough. There’s no point in bleating about it. ‘We didn’t take opportunities, didn’t do what we should have done, were not clever enough during parts of the game to deserve to win.’ But there was more than a little sense that Ian Ritchie was playing to his audience at Twickenham. And not only because the RFU’s affable chief executive quoted Hamlet when describing the ‘slings and arrows of outrageous fortune’ he experienced watching the engrossing Six Nations denouement. His public pronouncements were designed to strike a chord with those still uncomfortable with the six-year contracts served to England’s coaches last year. They were also designed as a shot across head coach Stuart Lancaster’s bows. RFU chief executive Ian Ritchie (right) chats to Lancaster at England's base in Pennyhill Park in Bagshot . Ritchie (left) and Lancaster talk in the Twickenham stands prior to England's clash with New Zealand . Ritchie, an intelligent and thoughtful man, needed very little pressing to deliver the headline-grabbing line that England’s fourth successive runners-up spot under Lancaster was ‘unacceptable’. Often it takes hundreds of questions to extract such strong quotes from a senior figure. Yesterday it took two. It was almost as if Ritchie had decided what he was going to say in advance. This was no slip of the tongue. More a clever piece of brinkmanship designed to keep the pressure on Lancaster. The aim was also to avoid accusations that complacency has crept into an organisation which has pulled itself back from the brink in the public’s eyes since the dark days surrounding the scandal-hit 2011 World Cup campaign. Ritchie, the man at the top of an organisation now delivering everywhere but on the pitch, felt the need to crack the whip. Just not too hard. ‘Four years as runners-up is not acceptable and we are not happy with how that came about,’ said the former chief executive of the All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club. ‘If you go back through history, bearing in mind a lot of things, we should be, as a country, winning more in terms of Grand Slams, Six Nations championships, other things. We had opportunities, let’s be clear — entirely in our control. The Irish deserved the win because of what they did over the five matches. ‘We did not do enough over the five matches. There’s no point in bleating about it. We simply didn’t take opportunities, didn’t do what we should have done, were not clever enough during parts of the game to deserve to win.’ England winger Jack Nowell bursts through for the first of his two tries against Les Bleus . In six months, the RFU will host a tournament which is predicted to generate close to £1billion for the UK economy. Success for the home nation on the field is critical for fans, sponsors, media and administrators alike. The RFU’s strategic vision, which Ritchie helped draw up, decreed that England should head into the World Cup with a Six Nations title under their belt and a world ranking no lower than second. For all the brilliance of Saturday’s seven-try triumph over France, watched by 9.6million on terrestrial television, they have achieved neither. But the natural question if results are ‘unacceptable’ is ‘so what are the consequences?’ Surely there is no point having targets if shoulders are simply shrugged when they are not met. But, with six-year deals secured, the reality is that Lancaster and his tight-knit coaching team of Andy Farrell, Mike Catt and Graham Rowntree are going nowhere in a hurry. ‘It’s quite right in any management to have targets,’ insisted Ritchie. ‘But they’re not the be-all and end-all. You’ve got to look around at the totality of what’s going on, where we are and what we believe. Frontline players such as Owen Farrell (left) and Manu Tuilagi were unavailable for the Six Nations . ‘Have we missed some targets? Well, yes. We wanted to win the Six Nations. We wanted to be ranked two in the world. ‘We remain confident and optimistic with a belief we can do well at the World Cup. We remain absolutely confident, happy and committed to the team that we’ve got on the coaching staff.’ England were hamstrung by injuries in the build-up to the tournament. No fewer than 11 players were ruled out of their opening win over Wales in Cardiff and first-choice stars Manu Tuilagi, Joe Launchbury, Ben Morgan and Owen Farrell were absent for the duration. Stuart Lancaster with his tight-knit coaching team of Graham Rowntree (left), Mike Catt and Andy Farrell . That resulted in the emphasis being placed on youngsters such as George Ford, Anthony Watson and Jonathan Joseph, with Lancaster and his staff keen to highlight the depth that has emerged. But Ritchie, the man in charge of a union which makes more than twice as much money as any other in the world and has access to more players, added: ‘“We’re developing, this is a development opportunity” — I don’t take that. ‘We’ve got the resources, the talent, the ability. We’ve got to make sure we come out for the World Cup and deliver.’",RFU chief executive Ian Ritchie branded England's second-placed Six Nations finish as 'unacceptable' The World Cup will commence in six months time .

"Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and top U.S. officials faced off Monday in dueling speeches on the high-stakes Iran nuclear negotiations, a signature foreign policy objective of President Barack Obama. 'Imagine what Iran would do with nuclear weapons,' he warned on Tuesday, saying that the Islamic republic is already training, arming and dispatching terrorists on five continents. Asked whether President Obama watched the speech, White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest told reporters: 'I don’t believe that he did.' Netanyahu says a nuclear-capable Iran would have the means to achieve its stated goal of annihilating Israel. He listed a litany of instances when Israel has acted on its own, in defiance of the U.S., to protect itself. The Obama administration is pursuing talks with Tehran that critics say could ultimately allow the kind of nuclear enrichment inside Iran that Netanyahu fears most. U.N. Ambassador Samantha Power insisted on Monday in a speech preceding Netanyahu's that it will 'never' happen. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, flanked by one of his security guards, addressed the 2015 American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC) Policy Conference in Washington on Monday . Netanyahu insisted that 'reports of the demise of the U.S.-Israel relation is not just premature; they are wrong' The backdrop for the rift between the longtime allies was the annual policy conference of the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, the largest pro-Israel lobby in the U.S. On Tuesday Netanyahu will address the U.S. Congress. Despite some Democrats' boycotting, demand to see the speech is brisk. 'We’ve had 10 times the number of requests for tickets than there are seats available in the gallery,' House Speaker John Boehner said Monday in an emailed statement. 'In fact, demand is so overwhelming that both the House and Senate have set up separate viewing locations, which are also ticketed events.' Each House member gets a single ticket to give away. 'I could scalp that ticket, there are so many people who want it,' Michigan GOP Rep. Tim Walberg told The Washington Times. 'In fact, demand is so overwhelming that both the House and Senate have set up separate viewing locations, which are also ticketed events.' Obama has repeatedly cautioned Israel not to launch pre-emptive attacks against Tehran, but Netanyahu suggested Monday that he could choose to act unilaterally as his country has done in the past, even at the risk of alienating the United States. Sara Netanyahu, wife of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, attended her husband's speech at the American Israel Public Affairs Committee policy conference on Monday . 'In 1948, Secretary of State George Marshall opposed David Ben-Gurion's intention to declare statehood,' Netanyahu recalled. 'That's an understatement – he vehemently opposed it. But, Ben-Gurion, understanding what was at stake, went ahead and declared Israel's independence.' 'In 1967, as an Arab noose was tightening around Israel's neck, the United States warned ... that if Israel acted alone, it would be alone. But Israel did act – acted alone – to defend itself.' 'In 1981, under the leadership of Prime Minister Menachem Begin, Israel destroyed a nuclear reactor at Osirak,' Netanyahu continued. 'The United States criticized Israel and suspended arms-transfers for three months. 'And in 2002, after the worst wave of Palestinian terror attacks in Israel's history, Prime Minister Sharon launched Operation Defensive Shield. The United States demanded that Israel withdraw its troops immediately but Sharon continued until the operation was completed.' 'I mention them to make a point,' he said. 'Despite occasional disagreements, the friendship between America and Israel grew stronger and stronger, decade after decade. And our friendship will weather the current disagreements as well to grow even stronger in the future.' US United Nations Ambassador Samantha Power told AIPAC that the United States will 'never' allow Iran to have a nuclear weapon . The alliance between Israel and the Unites States is 'stronger than ever,' Netanyahu finally insisted, quelling fears of a rift between his Likud Party and Obama's Democratic Party. He insisted that 'reports of the demise of the U.S.-Israel relation is not just premature; they are wrong.' 'My speech is not intended to show any disrespect to President Obama or the office that he holds. I have great respect for both,' he said. 'I deeply appreciate all the President Obama has done for Israel: Security cooperation, intelligence sharing, support in the UN and much more.' 'The last thing anyone who cares about Israel, the last thing that I would want, is for Israel to become a partisan issue,' he added, 'and I regret that some people have misperceived my visit here this week as doing that. Israel has always been a bipartisan issue. Israel should always remain a bipartisan issue.' Netanyahu addressed the gathering Monday morning at the Walter E. Williams Convention Center, bracketed by remarks from two senior U.S. officials: Power and National Security Adviser Susan Rice. The Obama administration hedged  last week about whether it would send someone to speak, and who it might be, after Daily Mail Online raised the subject during a White House briefing. Power insisted that 'The United States of America will not allow Iran to obtain a nuclear weapon, period.' 'Talks, no talks, agreement, no agreement, the United States will take whatever steps are necessary to protect our national security and that of our closest allies,' she said to an audience of thousands. 'We believe diplomacy is the preferred route to secure our shared aim. But if diplomacy fails, we know the stakes of a nuclear-armed Iran as well as everyone here. We will not let it happen. There will never be a sunset on America's commitment to Israel's security. Never.' She also criticized Netanyahu for 'politicizing' the Iran debate, saying U.S.-Israeli relations 'should never be politicized and it cannot and will not be tarnished or broken.' Netanyahu's visit to Washington has sparked criticism in both the U.S. and Israel. The centerpiece of his trip is an address to Congress Tuesday, which came at the invitation of congressional Republicans and was not coordinated with the White House. HOUSE MEMBERS . Rep.

Neither President Obama nor Vice President Biden will meet with the prime minister while he's in Washington, citing a desire to avoid the appearance of picking a side in Israel's upcoming elections. A close Obama adviser, though, former presidential campaign aide Jeremy Bird, is in Israel working to help Netanyahu's opposition defeat him. Rice has been particularly sharp in her criticism of Netanyahu's plans to address Congress, calling the move 'destructive' to the fabric of the U.S.-Israel relationship. The Israeli leader is deeply suspicious of Obama's efforts to reach a nuclear agreement with Iran, fearing the U.S. and its negotiating partners are prepared to leave Tehran on the cusp of developing a nuclear weapon. A Netanyahu adviser told reporters traveling to Washington with the prime minister on Sunday that he was not coming to the U.S. capital to offend Obama. 'The prime minister is here to warn, in front of any stage possible, the dangers' of the agreement that may be taking shape, the adviser said, speaking anonymously under a policy that bars the official from speaking on the record. Netanyahu outlined policy differences with the White House on Monday . Pro-Palestine demonstrators wore Netanyahu masks and showed symbolic 'blood stained hands' on Sunday during protests led by Code Pink . The adviser said Israel was well aware of the details of the emerging nuclear deal and they included Western compromises that were dangerous for Israel. Still, he tried to lower tensions by saying that Israel 'does not oppose every deal' and was merely doing its best to warn the U.S. of the risks entailed in the current one. As Netanyahu was preparing to speak, Secretary of State John Kerry was in Switzerland for another round of talks with Iran. The U.S. is seeking to secure a framework agreement to curtail Iran's nuclear program in exchange for sanctions relief ahead of a late-March deadline. The U.S. is negotiating alongside Britain, France, Germany, Russia and China.","White House says Obama did not watch Netanyahu's speech on Monday .

"Every MP in the country is to get a brand new iPad after the general election, costing the tax payer £1million. The House of Commons Commission claimed that offering all 650 ministers a new laptop or iPad Air 2, would actually save money. Liberal Democrat John Thurso, who represents the commission in the chamber, said moving away from Apple's products would be too expensive. Caught in the act: Tory MP Nigel Mills was caught playing Candy Crush on his taxpayer-funded iPad last December . But Shadow Cabinet Office minister Chi Onwurah criticised the decision to lock MPs into the Apple operating system and told Computerworld UK she would have preferred a 'device agnostic' policy. 'As we saw with Nigel Mills and Candy Crush, MPs will be using the games, and the iTunes and other features on the iPad,' she added. 'Locking some of the most powerful people in the country into a platform that most of my constituents can't afford seems like a mistake. And that's without mentioning the tax avoidance issue. I'm pushing for a device independent digital platform for Parliament.' Liberal Democrat John Thurso claimed a move away from Apple's operating system would  incur more costs . Apple iPads have been used across Parliament since a pilot scheme was launched in 2012. Currently 209 MPs have taxpayer-funded tablets with the understanding they use them for working while on the move in Parliament. But last December a Tory MP was caught playing a game on his iPad for more than two hours during a meeting. Nigel Mills escaped punishment after he admitted having a ‘game or two’ of Candy Crush and promised not to do it again. Mr Mills, the MP for Amber Valley in Derbyshire, was supposed to be listening to experts give evidence at a meeting of the Commons Work and Pensions Committee. He had initially said he would merely ‘try’ not to be diverted by the game again, but yesterday afternoon in a statement he said: ‘I guarantee it will not happen again. In 2013, the House of Commons Commission agreed to a recommendation from the administration committee that 'a tablet and a laptop should be the first pieces of equipment offered to all members after the 2015 election'. The Commission assessed a range of tablets with prices ranging from £100 to £600 and where they decided on the Apple iPad Air 2. The cost of supplying the new iPads would be £200,000 a year over the life of the next Parliament. Mr Thurso said the decision to buy the new gadgets was to avoid spending more money on training staff to use non-Apple systems and to reduce hard copy printing in favour of online publication which was already saving more than £3 million annually. The House of Commons Commission said that buying the 650 MPs an iPad Air 2 each, worth £499, will save money . 'Having been in use across Parliament since 2012, iPads are integrated with current business processes and infrastructure,' he said. 'A move away from the Apple operating system (iOS) at this time would incur costs to change these processes. 'Members are able to access the intranet and intranet hosted services via their iPads, they are able to access and annotate committee papers and can download a number of Office apps to access any content held within Office 365. 'There would be a significant change to move existing members to a different tablet operating system. Any departure from iOS would require re-training for the current members using iOS and new training to be developed for the remaining 441 members and all relevant PICT support staff.'",Every MP in the country is to be offered a brand new iPad worth £499 each .

'I think, to be acknowledged by Dior is just, it means a lot as a woman to feel beautiful, and elegant, and timeless.' Last week, Dior's decision to cast the chart-topper as the newest face of its spring-inspired Secret Garden campaign, which is currently in its fourth year, was met with an overwhelming amount of support, both from the fashion industry, and from the label's fans. '#HistoRIH @rihanna is gonna be the first BLACK WOMAN to be the face of Dior!!!!!' one person tweeted, while another added: 'Huge news for @rihanna today: she's the first black woman to be the face of Dior.' Dior confirmed that it had signed Rihanna up as its newest campaign star on Friday. According to WWD.com, the French-based brand stated that Rihanna is set to feature in the fourth installment of the video and print series of the Secret Garden campaign, joining models such as Daria Strokus, Melissa Stasiuk and Xiao Wen Ju, all of whom have previously featured in the Secret Garden series. While further details about the campaign have not yet been released, the fashion label confirmed that film and print versions, shot by photographer Steven Klein, 'are scheduled to run this spring'. Big deal: While discussing her soon-to-be-released animated movie Home, Rihanna explained how important she believes her new Dior campaign will be for 'a lot of young girls of any color' Anticipation: The chart-topper added that she was thrilled just to be 'recognized' by the iconic French fashion label . The announcement was made just days after the popstar was spotted filming in the ornate surroundings of the Palace of Versailles in Paris, France, where all of Dior's previous Secret Garden campaigns have been shot. Rihanna was seen strolling through the Palace's luxurious rooms during the late night shoot, while wearing a glamorous sequin gown - and a pair of fluffy slippers. Her thick hair was styled in luxurious waves, swept back off her face to allow her features to shine, while a bold dark lipstick spiced up the look. Rihanna posed among a hallway of gold statues as cameras flashed away. Earlier that day, the star was also seen enjoying some downtime in her trailer, which was located at the Palace. Rihanna was pictured lying down, while having her nails done by an assistant. Strike a pose: Rihanna was seen working on a photoshoot for the upcoming campaign at the Palace of Versailles on Tuesday night . Couture: The popstar was modeling a beautifully-cut black Dior gown and red leather gloves . Just a few days later, Rihanna was back at work on another night shoot at the Palace, this time posing up a storm in the estate's impressive grounds while wearing a beautifully-tailored black gown. The sleeveless dress featured a striking white leather waist belt which of course simply highlighted the singer's slim frame. Adding her own signature style to the ensemble, Rihanna decided to pull down the zip featured down the front of the frock, which revealed a hint of side boob. This new campaign will mark Rihanna's debut as a model for the brand - however she is known to be a great fan of the brand, and is often seen wearing a variety of Dior's latest and greatest designs while frequently featuring on the front row at the label's Paris Fashion Week catwalk shows. And while Rihanna has not previously modeled for Dior, the star does boast plenty of fashion experience, having previously modeled for the likes of Balmain and Emporio Armani, as well as appearing on numerous covers of fashion bible Vogue. She joins the likes of Hunger Games star Jennifer Lawrence, Black Swan actress Natalie Portman and French beauty Marion Cotillard, all of whom have starred in campaigns for Dior in the past.

The last installment of the Secret Garden campaign, which debuted in May 2014, has had more than nine million views on YouTube. It was also shot at the iconic French palace. Making clear the key role that the historical setting plays within the campaign, Dior said of its previous video installment: 'As the eyes open upon the famed perspective of the chateau gardens and their massive geometries, as on the cusp of a dream, the Dior woman draws the spectator with her around the twists and turns of a secret and amazing Versailles.' Known also as the Chateau de Versailles, the extravagant royal residence is located just southwest of Paris. Three French kings lived there, including Louis XIII, Louis XIV, and Louis XV, up until the French revolution in 1789. Each king increased the palace’s splendour by continuing to build upon the premises.",Last week Dior confirmed that the 27-year-old popstar had been chosen to front the latest installment of the fashion label's Secret Garden campaign .

"A heavily pregnant woman killed along with her seven-year-old son had been living with and caring for her 52-year-old father when all three were shot dead. Kris-Deann Sharpley was on maternity leave and excitedly awaiting the birth of her little girl who she’d chosen to name Amber Elizabeth Rose after her late mother when she was slain, her sister-in-law Sara Turnball told the Courier Mail. Kris-Deann’s body was found in a bathroom in her father Derek John Sharpley’s home while the body of her son Jackson was discovered tucked up in bed. Mr Sharpley’s body was found in the same bedroom and police believe he shot himself after killing his daughter and grandson. The horrific double-murder suicide has rocked the small town of Biddeston, west of Brisbane in Queensland where it took place. Kris-Deann Sharpley (left) was found dead in the bathroom while he son Jackson (right) was found in his bed . Jackson was discovered murdered while still tucked up in bed but police are not certain of how he died yet . All three bodies were found by Kris-Deann’s sister Tara on Monday evening when she came to the house to pick up some belongings and to see their pet dogs. Tara, who is also pregnant, was accompanied by her boyfriend Allan Brown and had to climb through a window to gain access to the house. Derek Jackson's body was found in the bedroom with a gunshot wound . Mr Brown told the Courier Mail that Tara screamed out: ‘They’ve been murdered, they’ve been murdered.’ The scene at Toowoomba-Cecil Plains Road home was so grisly it distressed first-response police officers, according to Detective Inspector David Isherwood. 'Two of the victims, both the adult male and female, had very serious wounds to their bodies,' he said. 'Both appear to have been shot in the head.' A high-calibre weapon was found lying on a bed but police have not established how Jackson, discovered in a bedroom with Derek, died. Police have said Mr Sharpley's death is not considered suspicious but DI Isherwood stopped short of confirming the tragedy was a double murder-suicide. 'I will say that they are known to police,' he said. 'At this point in time there's nothing to suggest there was any incident that occurred in terms of a disturbance.' DI Isherwood earlier said that investigations indicate that there is no further threat to public safety. 'I must stress that we are in the early stages of our investigation however it would appear that two of the deaths are suspicious and the death of the man is non suspicious,' he said. 'Two people that live in the town heard three distinct gunshots,' DI Isherwood said. The gunshots were heard on Sunday night but locals presumed it was someone shotting an animal.

"A Tumblr user has claimed that every female character used in a Disney or Pixar film in the last decade has the same face. The post by Every-Flavored-Bean on the Something Classy blog was uploaded after they saw stills from the new film Inside Out - and noticed the similarities between the women's faces. They then combined a number of characters from recent productions and traced around their cheeks and noses - apparently proving the similarities. Scroll down for video . Tumblr user Every-Flavored Bean  around the faces of female characters from Disney and Pixar, highlighting their similarities . They suggested that every female character from the last decade is a 'descendant of some primordial creature' with 'huge round cheeks and a disturbingly small nose'. They then go on to say that the reason behind the similarities is 'lazy sexism'. The user wrote: 'So when I saw this picture for the new Pixar movie Inside Out, at first I thought the characters were three women and two aliens, but after seeing the trailer I realized the purple and red things were supposed to be dudes. 'After tracing their faces, I figured out why I was so weirded out: The two male characters have extremely distinctive face shapes, while the three female characters basically have the exact same shape; round with a small nose. The allegations follow on from claims made by Frozen's head of animation, Lindo De Salvo, in 2013 who said creating the female characters was tricky because you have to 'keep them pretty.' They did the same with male faces and noticed that most of them were different . They first spotted the distinctions when looking at stills from the new animated film Inside Out . The green drawings (male) and the red lines (female) show the differences between the two . According to a Tumblr user, he said: 'Historically speaking, animating female characters are really, really difficult, because they have to go through these range of emotions, but you have to keep them pretty and they’re very sensitive to — you can get them off a model very quickly.

"Portugal manager Fernando Santos has revealed his desire to sew up qualification for Euro 2016 before their return trip to face Serbia in a tricky tie in Belgrade on the final day of qualifying. Santos' side face Serbia at Lisbon's Estadio da Luz on Sunday, hoping that star man and captain Cristiano Ronaldo can help open up a gap on one of their rivals for a place at the finals in France next summer. With a win offering the Portuguese a chance to leapfrog Denmark at the top of the group, Santos wants to take what he sees as a key step towards sealing qualification. Cristiano Ronaldo (left) and Fernando Santos (right) talk ahead of Portugal's Euro 2016 qualifier on Sunday . Santos has made it clear that the game against Serbia is very important to their qualification hopes . Ronaldo took the chance to show off during training as Portugal went through their paces on Saturday . Speaking after training, Santos said: 'The game is not decisive but it is very important. We depend only on ourselves, and if we win we get to depend only of us in an even stronger way. In this sense it is a very important game. 'The desire is to go to Belgrade (when they face Serbia on October 11) with qualification from the group already guaranteed.' Ronaldo has scored both of low-scoring Portugal's two goals in qualifying so far, securing late wins over Denmark and Armenia after a shock opening-fixture defeat by Albania.

Despite Serbia's poor record in qualifying so far - taking just one point from three games - they do boast a number of stars from Europe's top divisions, including Chelsea pair Nemanja Matic and Branislav Ivanovic as well as Liverpool winger Lazar Markovic. However, Santos said that he would not be preparing his players to give any 'special attention' to any opposition players. 'There will be no special care for anyone,' he said. 'Portugal respects all of their players, Matic, (Zoran) Tosic, Markovic, I won't go on as I would have to name them all.

"Rory McIlroy has worn the air of a man intent on peaking at the right time this week. He has played well, racking up five birdies in succession at one point during his second round at the Arnold Palmer Invitational, the first time he has accomplished that on the PGA Tour, but there has still been a sense of a man playing within himself.

"They say money can corrupt even the most honest of people. Now one social psychologist has revealed a series of experiments that shows this adage to be true. Instead of transforming people into a charitable benefactors, Professor Paul Piff believes money causes people to break the rules at the expense of others. Professor Paul Piff from the University of California, Berkeley, has revealed several experiments in which the rich struggled with empathy and generosity towards others, compared with their poorer companions . 'It makes you more attuned to your own interests, your own desires, your own welfare,' the University of California, Berkeley, researcher told Lucy Hooker at the BBC. 'It isolates you in certain ways from other people psychologically and materially. You prioritise your own needs and your own goals and become less attuned to those around you. In one experiment, Professor Piff spent an afternoon going back and forth over a pedestrian crossing in Los Angeles. He found that none of the least expensive cars broke the law, while almost 50 per cent of the most expensive car drivers sped across the pedestrian crossing. In another recent study, Professor Piff brought in more than 100 pairs of strangers into the lab, and flipped a coin to assigned one of the two to be a rich player in a rigged Monopoly game. The rich players collected twice the salary when they passed Go, and they were able to roll both dice instead of one, so they got to move around the board more. Money isolates people psychologically and materially, according to recent research. As a result they prioritise their own needs and goals and become less attuned to those around them . Hidden cameras revealed, over the course of 15 minutes, the rich player showing signs of dominance, smacking the board with their piece and talking loudly. The rich players also became ruder toward the other person, less sensitive to the plight of the poor players, and more demonstrative of their material success. The feeling of power has been found to have a similar effect on the brain to cocaine. It increases the levels of testosterone and its by-product 3-androstanediol in both men and women. This in turn leads to raised levels of dopamine, the brain's reward system called the nucleus accumbens, which can be very addictive. Like cocaine, scientists now believe power can lead to too much dopamine causing more negative effects such as arrogance and impatience. 'When the rich players talked about why they had inevitably won in this rigged game of Monopoly they talked about what they'd done to buy those different properties and earn their success in the game,' Professor Piff said in a recent Ted talk. 'They became far less attuned to all those different features of the situation, including that flip of a coin that had randomly gotten them into that privileged position in the first place. 'And that's a really, really incredible insight into how the mind makes sense of advantage.' Other scientists have conducted similar studies to back up the findings. Last year, after undergoing psychological testing to measure individual differences, including honesty, a group of volunteers in Switzerland played the 'dictator game'. In the game, they were given complete control over deciding pay outs to themselves and their followers. The leaders had the choice of making pro or anti-social decisions - the latter resulting in awarding less money to the group but more to the leader's own earnings. The findings showed those rated as less honest at first exhibited more corrupt behaviour. But, over time, even those who initially scored high on honesty scales were not shielded from the corruptive effects of power, according to the University of Lausanne in Switzerland. Professor Piff, however, says not all hope is lost for the wealthy. 'We've been finding in our own laboratory research that small psychological interventions, small changes to people's values, small nudges in certain directions, can restore levels of egalitarianism and empathy. 'For instance, reminding people of the benefits of cooperation, or the advantages of community, cause wealthier individuals to be just as egalitarian as poor people.' In one study, volunteers watched a brief video, 46 seconds long, about childhood poverty that served as a reminder of the needs of others in the world around them. 'After watching this video, an hour later, rich people became just as generous of their own time to help out this other person, a stranger, as someone who's poor,' said Professor Piff.","This is according to Paul Piff from University of California, Berkeley . His tests reveal money isolates people psychologically and materially . In a rigged game of monopoly, richer players were rude and dominant . Another study found people in better cars were more likely to break law .",207243f8179ed42de850bdfaa34034d6e200a786
"(CNN)Angelina Jolie took the stage Saturday at Nickelodeon's 28th Annual Kids' Choice Awards and delivered a message of hope to anyone who's ever felt out of place. In her first public appearance since revealing that she underwent a second preventive surgery to lower her risk of cancer, Jolie attended the show with her children, Shiloh and Zahara. She hugged them before she went to the stage to accept the favorite villain award for her role as Maleficent in the live-action reimagining of ""Sleeping Beauty."" ""When I was little, like Maleficent, I was told that I was different.  And I felt out of place -- too loud, too full of fire, never good at sitting still, never good at fitting in,"" the 39-year-old actor and humanitarian said. ""And, then one day I realized something, something that I hope you all realize: Different is good,"" she said, prompting enthusiastic screams from the young crowd. ""And, as your villain, I would also say cause a little trouble -- it's good for you."" Jolie's career has been full of unconventional twists and turns, from her breakthrough role in the biopic ""Gia"" to her current role as an actor, filmmaker and special envoy of the U.N.'s High Commissioner for Refugees. Her personal life also has made front page headlines over the years, including her adoption of children from developing countries and her candor in discussing her health. Jolie, 39, wrote Tuesday in a New York Times essay that she had opted for the surgery after blood tests revealed markers that might have been an indication of early cancer. Two years ago, she underwent a double mastectomy for similar reasons. Jolie's mother died of ovarian cancer, and the actress has a gene mutation that makes her chances of developing breast cancer and ovarian cancer much higher than the overall population. Jolie's revelation provoked an outpouring of support as the news spread across social media. ""It is not easy to make these decisions. But it is possible to take control and tackle head-on any health issue. You can seek advice, learn about the options and make choices that are right for you.

"What are the chances you will live for another ten years? While your GP might give you some idea, scientists now say you can accurately predict your likelihood of death using a calculator and a treadmill. The process involves running in three-minute segments on a treadmill with an increasing speed and at a growing incline. Scroll down to read DailyMail.com review of the test... Scientists say you can accurately predict your likelihood of death using a calculator and a treadmill. The process involves running in three-minute segments on a treadmill with an increasing speed . Runners then plug in their vital statistics into a basic formula to find out how likely they are to die over the next decade. Dubbed the FIT Treadmill Score, the test was created by cardiologists at Johns Hopkins University in Maryland after studying 58,000 stress exams. 'The notion that being in good physical shape portends lower death risk is by no means new,' said lead investigator Haitham Ahmed. 'But we wanted to quantify that risk precisely by age, gender and fitness level, and do so with an elegantly simple equation that requires no additional fancy testing beyond the standard stress test.' The test consists of three-minute segments that increase in speed and incline. Follow the below stages in order to see which MET score you reach. Make sure you record your heart rate during each exercise. Stage 1 - 1.7 mph/10 per cent grade/5 METs . Stage 2 - 2.5 mph/12 per cent grade/7 METs . Stage 3 - 3.4 mph/14 per cent grade/10 METs . Stage 4 - 4.2 mph/16 per cent grade/13 METs . Stage 5 - 5.0 mph/18 per cent grade/15 METs . Stage 6 - 5.5 mph/20 per cent grade/18 METs . Stage 7 - 5.5 mph/22 per cent grade/20 METs . Then put in your details in to the following formula: . (12 x METs) + (% of maximum predicted heart rate) – (4 x age) + 43 if female. Maximum predicted heart rate is calculated as 220 – age. Heart rate achieved during exercise should be divided by maximum predicted. If you have at least zero, your survival rate is 97 percent in the next decade. In the study, scores ranged from negative 200 to positive 200. If you score 100 or higher, you have have a two percent risk of dying over the next 10 years, while those with scores between 0 and 100 face a three per cent death risk over the next decade. If you have a score between negative 100 and 0 had an 11 per cent risk of dying in the next 10 years, while scores lower than negative 100 have a 38 per cent risk of dying in a decade. As well as age and gender, the formula factors in peak heart rate reached during intense exercise and the ability to tolerate physical exertion as measured by so-called metabolic equivalents, or METs . As well as age and gender, the formula factors in peak heart rate reached during intense exercise and the ability to tolerate physical exertion as measured by so-called metabolic equivalents, or METs. This is a gauge of how much energy the body expends during exercise. More vigorous activities require higher energy output – or higher METs. An activity such as slow walking equals two METs, compared with eight for running. For the study, the team analysed information on 58,020 people, ages 18 to 96, from Detroit, Michigan, who underwent standard exercise stress tests between 1991 and 2009 for evaluation of chest pain, shortness of breath, fainting or dizziness. The researchers then tracked how many of the participants within each fitness level died from any cause over the next decade. 'Get busy living or get busy dying'. These were the famous words of advice Andy offered to Red during his life sentence in Shawshank Redemption. They were the same words that were going round my head as I stepped up to the 'When am I going to die challenge'. I'm a 33-year-old man of average height and build with an emerging paunch. I spent my twenties drinking and smoking but thanks to a second go at hypnosis, I knocked the smokes on the head last year. I consider myself fairly healthy having passed my formative years swimming, cycling and playing football. Now, when I can be bothered, I go to Bikram yoga and run. The paunch bothers me. I looked at the test and thought: Easy, before hauling myself off to the Young Man's Hebrew Association on 14th. I fired up the treadmill and got going. Stage 1 - 1.7 mph/10 per cent grade/5 METs . Easy. I walk twice as fast. Stage 2 - 2.5 mph/12 per cent grade/7 METs . Still easy but it reminded me why hate treadmills. They make walking and running so boring. Should have brought my headphones. Stage 3 - 3.4 mph/14 per cent grade/10 METs . Incline jump is considerate and I'm starting to feel it. What is wrong with me? The Grim Reaper is on my tail. Stage 4 - 4.2 mph/16 per cent grade/13 METs . It was all that food and booze at Christmas. I should have done Dry January. Must stop going to Ray's pizza. I'm not going to finish this I know it. Stage 5 5.0 mph/18 per cent grade/15 METs . No can do. Treadmill doesn't go up as far as 20 per cent and thank God. I'm beat. I'm done. No way I can do last two stages. Pathetic. So there. 12 mins no more. It was the incline that got me. Much harder than I thought. If the test is accurate I've got two per cent chance of dying in the next ten years. I'll take that. Not as bad as I thought. Unlike Andy from Shawshank Redemption, I haven't got to start digging just yet. Sean O'Hare for DailyMail.com . The results reveal that among people of the same age and gender, fitness level as measured by METs, and peak heart rate reached during exercise were the greatest indicators of death risk. Fitness level was the single most powerful predictor of death and survival, even after researchers accounted for other important variables such as diabetes and family history of premature death. Scores ranged from negative 200 to positive 200, with those above 0 having lower mortality risk and those in the negative range facing highest risk of dying. Patients who scored 100 or higher had a 2 per cent risk of dying over the next 10 years, while those with scores between 0 and 100 faced a 3 per cent death risk over the next decade. People with scores between negative 100 and 0 had an 11 percent risk of dying in the next 10 years, while those with scores lower than negative 100 had a 38 per cent risk of dying. 'The FIT Treadmill Score is easy to calculate and costs nothing beyond the cost of the treadmill test itself,' says senior study author Michael Blaha. The results reveal that among people of the same age and gender, fitness level as measured by METs, and peak heart rate reached during exercise were the greatest indicators of death risk . Exercise stress tests usually measure how well the heart and lungs respond to physical exertion while a person is walking on a treadmill at progressively higher speed and elevation. The test is stopped once a person reaches the point of exhaustion or develops chest pain, dizziness or heart rhythm abnormalities. Those who have normal readings and no alarming symptoms while exercising are said to have 'normal' results and typically do not require further testing. However, the researchers say, the new data show varying degrees of fitness among those with 'normal' stress test results that reveal telling clues about cardiac and respiratory fitness and, therefore, overall death risk over time. 'Stress test results are currently interpreted as 'either/or' but we know that heart disease is a spectrum disorder,' Dr Ahmed says. 'We believe that our FIT score reflects the complex nature of cardiovascular health and can offer important insights to both clinicians and patients.'","Test involves running in three-minute segments on a treadmill .

"(CNN)It recalled one of the most memorable moments in comic book history, but for critics on social media, one comic book cover went too far, and it's now been pulled. DC Comics pulled the cover for the upcoming ""Batgirl"" #41, which portrays the Joker threatening a frightened Batgirl with a gun, with ""Joker makeup"" on her mouth. The Twitter hashtag #changethecover had been trending since Friday, when the cover was revealed. It's a variant, aka an optional cover, which tends to grab the attention of collectors but won't be the main cover seen in most stores. For the month of June, DC's variant covers are celebrating the 75th anniversary of the iconic villain. The cover recalls Barbara ""Batgirl"" Gordon's encounter with the Joker in the classic story ""The Killing Joke."" In it, he brutally attacked Barbara, kidnapping her, and it was heavily implied that she was sexually assaulted. After being shot, the character remained in a wheelchair for decades, until DC retconned Barbara's fate in 2011, allowing her to walk again and be Batgirl. The criticism of the cover spread over a few days, though others defended it with their own hashtags. DC Comics (owned by Time Warner, which also owns CNN) said in a statement late Monday that artist Rafael Albuquerque's cover was going to be pulled. ""Regardless if fans like Rafael Albuquerque's homage to Alan Moore's THE KILLING JOKE graphic novel from 25 years ago, or find it inconsistent with the current tonality of the Batgirl books -- threats of violence and harassment are wrong and have no place in comics or society,"" they said. ""We stand by our creative talent, and per Rafael's request, DC Comics will not publish the Batgirl variant. "" Albuquerque said in his own statement, ""My Batgirl variant cover artwork was designed to pay homage to a comic that I really admire, and I know is a favorite of many readers. 'The Killing Joke' is part of Batgirl's canon and artistically, I couldn't avoid portraying the traumatic relationship between Barbara Gordon and the Joker."" He continued, ""For me, it was just a creepy cover that brought up something from the character's past that I was able to interpret artistically. But it has become clear, that for others, it touched a very important nerve. I respect these opinions and, despite whether the discussion is right or wrong, no opinion should be discredited. He concluded, ""My intention was never to hurt or upset anyone through my art. For that reason, I have recommended to DC that the variant cover be pulled. I'm incredibly pleased that DC Comics is listening to my concerns and will not be publishing the cover art in June as previously announced."" Albuquerque added in a tweet on Monday night that he was never threatened (the ""threats"" DC referenced were aimed at those objecting to the cover, per ""Batgirl"" writer Cameron Stewart). Stewart tweeted more: ""I stand behind Rafael as an artist and a friend, and think he made the right decision. The cover was not seen or approved by anyone on Team Batgirl and was completely at odds with what we are doing with the comic. So, we have the creators of the book and the artist himself all agreeing that the cover was inappropriate. There's no 'censorship' here."" That didn't stop the controversy on social media. It was just the latest brouhaha involving portrayals of women in comic books and variant covers in particular.

"Lord Windermere, the 2014 Cheltenham Gold Cup winner, has been confirmed as a ‘definite’ starter in the Crabble’s Grand National at Aintree on Saturday week. Trainer Jim Culloty has made no public comment since the nine-year-old was pulled up behind Coneygree last month when trying to defend his title. Since that run jockey Davy Russell has lost the ride on Lord Windermere, although a broken arm 24 hours after that news emerged means Russell would not have been available anyway. The 2014 Gold Cup winner Lord Windermere has been confirmed as a definite Grand National starter . Culloty will also be represented by Spring Heeled, who also won at last season’ s Cheltenham Festival, as his launches a twin assault on the £1million prize. A spokeswoman for Culloty’s Co Cork stable said: ‘Both horses are definite runners. There are no concrete jockey plans at the moment.’ Victory for either gelding, both of which run in the colours of Dr Ronan Lambe, would make Culloty, who won the 2002 race as a jockey on board Bindaree, only the sixth man to both ride and train a Grand National winner. Trainer Jim Culloty has made no comment since the nine-year-old was pulled up behind Coneygree last month . Best known as the rider of three-time Cheltenham Gold Cup winner Best Mate, Culloty would also join Fred Winter as the only man to have ridden and trained the winner of both the Grand National and Gold Cup. Jockey options for the Culloty pair could include Robbie McNamara, who won the 2014 Fulke Walwyn Kim Muir Challenge Cup on Spring Heeled, who has been kept fresh for his National challenge. Spring Heeled is a 20-1 shot for the Aintree race but confirmation that Lord Windermere, due to carry top weight of 11st 10lb, will run could prompt the few bookmakers making his a 50-1 shot to trim his odds back in line with rivals. Trainer Jim Culloty's second representative Spring Heeled is a 20-1 shot for the Grand National at Aintree . Definitely out of the National is Jonjo O’Neill’s Merry King, who has a breathing problem while Nicky Henderson’s Hadrian’s Approach is rated ‘very doubtful’ after picking up a leg injury. Merry King’s exit frees up jockey Richie McLernon, who looks a riding option for Emma Lavelle’s Court By Surprise. Alan King has confirmed Godsmejudge, the 2013 Scottish National winner, run despite the gelding being beaten almost 70 lengths on his latest run over hurdles at Bangor. King said: ‘I don’t know what happened at Bangor.

"When it comes to making embarrassing gaffes, few in public life can match Mexican mayor Hilario Ramirez Villanueva. Already in hot water over admitting it was okay to steal - as long as it was only a little bit - he's now caused anger by flashing a young girl's bum on stage during his recent birthday party on the Pacific coast. To make matters worse, he then sent domestic appliances to women who complained. Mexican mayor Hilario Ramirez Villanueva is in hot water after exposing a girl's knickers to a crowd of 50,000 during his birthday celebrations . Local media said the young woman was a teenager under the age of 18, but there was little public criticism . The faux pas occurred when 44-year-old Villanueva, who is mayor of the city of San Blas, was invited to perform on stage with the band El Recodo. He was filmed dancing with a young girl as the group played then, as members of the 50,000-strong audience cheered, he lifted her skirt up, exposing her knickers. Local media said the young woman was a teenager under the age of 18, but there was little public criticism of him. After the tactless stunt he was bombarded with complaints from women's groups, but he exacerbated the issue by sending them irons and other domestic appliances such as refrigerators and cookers. The girl was clearly embarrassed and immediately pulled her skirt down afterwards . Villanueva was previously in the public spotlight when he admitted that during his first term as mayor he had stolen 'just a little bit' of cash from the public purse . He said that he recognised the equality of women with men 'and their right to develop as a person'. He was previously in the public spotlight when he admitted that during his first term as mayor, when he was a member of the right-wing political party PAN (National Action Party), he had stolen 'just a little bit' of cash from the public purse. Yet there were no official sanctions following the confession by Villanueva, nicknamed locally as 'Layin'. Birthday party reveller Irineo Galindo, 39, who was interviewed by local TV, said: 'I don't care what they say about him, he knows how to throw a good party. And that gets my vote in any election.' The party was reportedly kept moving not only by the band, but by the fact that the politician had provided 1,200,000 beers and meat from 50 cows that were butchered and roasted. According to local media, the party for 50,000 guests had cost 15million Mexican pesos (around £650,700/$970,000).",Hilario Ramirez Villanueva once admitted stealing from the public purse .

"A limp and lifeless Queens Park Rangers were destroyed by Crystal Palace, leaving their Barclays Premier League future severely in doubt. In a first half of utter domination the home side went three goals ahead with only three shots on target, while QPR failed to muster a single one. Already three points adrift of safety ahead of kick-off, QPR manager Chris Ramsey knew how imperative it was to get something from this game. His players did not respond. Joel Ward wheels away in celebration after finding the bottom corner with a well-placed effort to make it 3-0 to Crystal Palace . Ward gets his hot away just before QPR midfielder Sandro can get a block in as Palace raced into a 3-0 first-half lead . Ward heads towards team-mate Wilfried Zaha, who set up the goal with a brilliant run and pass . Crystal Palace (4-4-1-1): Speroni 6; Ward 7.5, Dann 7, Delaney 7, Kelly 7; Zaha 8.5 (Mariappa 57 6), Ledley 7, McArthur 7.5, Bolasie 8; Puncheon 7 (Gayle 55 6.5); Murray 6.5 (Sanogo 80).

Wilfried Zaha terrorised the QPR defence down the Palace right. CLICK HERE to see more from Sportsmail's MATCH ZONE . The first came after 21 minutes, Yannick Bolasie bursting down the left, easily past 19-year-old right-back Darnell Furlong, and sending a low ball across the box which Wilfried Zaha was able to slide in at the back post. He was almost split in two by the upright in the process, and was eventually substituted in the second half, given a standing ovation by the adoring Selhurst Park crowd for netting his first goal since making a permanent move back to south London in January. ‘If it meant colliding with the post, I had to get my goal,’ said Zaha, who had gingerly limped off, afterwards. ‘It will definitely hurt, but no pain, no gain. ‘We’ve been talking all week about getting into the box so as soon as Yannick got the ball I knew I had to get in there and get on the end of it.’ It took another 20 minutes for the second, Bolasie again simply out-pacing Furlong down the left and crossing low again. This time goalkeeper Rob Green got a hand to the ball but could not divert it out of the path of James McArther who finished into the open net. Matt Phillips unleashed a ferocious strike from 40 yards that found the top corner to pull a goal back for the visitors . Phillips' effort dipped and swerved past Julian Speroni but it was too little too late for Rangers, who fell to another away defeat . Phillips grabs the ball in a hurry as he makes his way back to the centre spot as QPR sense a late comeback . Bolasie’s relentless dismantling of teenager Furlong was painful to watch, like a grown man putting a puppy into a sack and repeatedly kicking it. But he was afforded some respite, at least, for the third, just 60 seconds later this time. Palace probed down the other flank, Zaha using skill to outwit a few QPR players before passing into Joel Ward who took a touch before bending the ball through a flurry of players and bouncing agonisingly into the far left of goal. Furlong, playing only his third game for QPR, was hooked at half-time, Clint Hill coming in at centre-back and Nedum Onuoha moving to right-back to try to deal with Bolasie’s threat. QPR manager Chris Ramsey claimed it was due to injury. ‘Darnell came off for no other reason that he’s got a bad calf,’ he said. ‘His calf stiffened up and it wouldn’t be fair to the boy to keep the boy on there hobbling.’ Ward is congratulated by team-mates James McArthur and Scott Dann after firing Palace into an unassailable lead against QPR . James McArthur doubled the home side's lead five minutes before half-time after tapping Yannick Bolasie's low cross into an empty net . McArthur leaps to his feet in celebration as he heads towards the provider Bolasie as Palace took a firm a grip on proceedings . Midfielder McArthur points to his shin with a smile on his face appearing to suggest the ball hadn't gone in off his boot . If Darnell was the puppy of the side, his team-mates finally produced some bite in the second half, even if it was all too late. They finally got an effort on target, after 72 minutes. From who else but Charlie Austin? The striker reached a cross first but could only direct at tame header down the middle which Palace goalkeeper Julian Speroni held. Then, out of nowhere, they pulled one back in the final 10 minutes, with one of the strikes of the season. Matt Phillips picked the ball up in the middle of the park and took a touch before belting an effort over Speroni and into the top left corner from 40 yards. With one minute remaining of the 90 he almost struck again, this time hitting a first-time drive from slightly to the right of goal, but Speroni was alert and dived to push it wide. Former Manchester United winger Wilfired Zaha slid in at the back post to turn home Bolasie's low cross to give Palace a first-half lead . The 22-year-old beat team-mate Jason Puncheon and QPR full back Yun Suk-Young to poke the ball home from close range . Zaha's momentum took him and Puncheon crashing into the post as both Palace players required treatment . Zaha and Puncheon both lay on the floor in pain after colliding with the post before both players were able to continue . James McArthur calls over to the bench for medical assistance as Palace's celebrations were cut short after taking the lead in the 21st minute . Palace manager Alan Pardew is targeting finishing above former club Newcastle, who he left in a shock move in December but has since reeled them to within reach. ‘I said to the players when I arrived to look above because if you look below there is anxiety and pressure,’ Pardew revealed. ‘You can't play like that. ‘You have to try to Newcastle, whoever is above us. We're above Everton, that was a bit of goal for us. Can we stay above them?’ But time is running out for QPR to stay in the league. ‘I’m hoping nine games is enough,’ Ramsey added. ‘That’s all that I’ve got, so we’ll go for it as best we can. ‘They’re still unified in what we’re trying to do, and all we can do really is to keep fighting.’ Even getting a stunning consolation goal flattered QPR at the final whistle and the fight is beginning to drain from them.",Crystal Palace beat Queens Park Rangers 3-1 in the Premier League at Selhurst Park on Saturday afternoon .

"The ponytail has gone, along with the modelling career and a shedload of money, but the ebullient Darragh MacAnthony is not a man to look back and dwell. There has been a book too — ‘just about the football club, it was a bit daft’ — not to mention an app ‘to keep results up to date, but it wasn’t very good’. Meanwhile, owning Peterborough has turned the League One club’s extrovert chairman into an anxious, superstitious obsessive — ‘my OCD is getting worse’. Peterborough chairman Darragh MacAnthony has been in charge at the club since 2006 . MacAnthony said he has no regrets about tweeting his disapproval of players . MacAnthony, who flirted with modelling as a 17-year-old, shows he has no concerns in front of the camera . Suited in a verging-on-baggy pinstripe, MacAnthony strides into his minimalist office at the training ground, past the empty bookshelves, and admits he has never sat at his huge, empty desk before. It turns out that the decorators have been in since he last made the trip from his Florida home. He likes it, especially the montage of family portraits which adorn the walls, even if they remind him how much he is missing wife Natalie and their children: Darcy, Callum and Cara, all under 10. There is an internal door to the manager’s office, currently occupied by interim boss Dave Robertson following the reluctant severing of an eight-year on-off relationship with Darren Ferguson. ‘So you thought I’d be in a tracksuit?’ He speaks in a soft Irish brogue but the words are delivered at rat-a-tat speed in a contradictory combination of dictatorial charm. His style is to cut to the chase. The answer to his question is yes. Based on the evidence of an 11-point Twitter demolition of his players two months ago, the assumption is that MacAnthony is an owner who likes to meddle. ‘I knew you’d get to that,’ said MacAnthony, or @DMAC102. ‘Give me 11 reasons not to talk about Twitter! MacAnthony shows he is not shy in front of the camera as he pauses to take a selfie . Darren Ferguson led Peterborough to the Championship after finishing second in League One in 2009 . ‘I have been caught saying things on Twitter which I probably shouldn’t have but my personality has always been honest and direct. I make mistakes, I am impulsive. ‘What did the players think? I didn’t need to ask. I spoke to them on Friday and joked “I’m going to give you 11 great reasons on Twitter why I’m happy” (five wins in six since Ferguson’s departure). ‘They know where I’m coming from and I don’t think any of them could argue with my points. I understand it’s not the done thing, but I didn’t buy a football club to live by the rules of the establishment. ‘Am I a frustrated football manager? No. I am an owner and a frustrated fan. If you look for a manager who says I said “you must play so and so”, you won’t find one.’ MacAnthony left Ireland for Spain with his family at 15 and by 29 had made a fortune from the property market, a large chunk of which went straight down the drain in the recession. The Peterborough chairman and director of football Barry Fry celebrate after winning the JPT Trophy in 2014 . MacAnthony described getting relegated  from the Championship in 2013 as his worst moment at the club . At 17 he flirted with modelling, influenced by his girlfriend at the time, and a fact gleaned as he comfortably poses for photographs. ‘I had a ponytail, which my Mum used to do for me. Natalie doesn’t believe it when I tell her I used to be a model, but it was good money.’ Another girlfriend tempted MacAnthony to London and college. He lasted two weeks before heading back to Spain. Buying a football club was a dream toy for the boy in 2006 and has remained a source of pain and pleasure ever since. ‘I was 28-29 and at the top of my game,’ recalled MacAnthony, now 39. ‘Then the recession came and the world nearly ended financially. It was tough, but the club kept me sane. ‘It’s hard to name one best moment as there have been so many but the worst is easy. We were relegated from the Championship on 54 points two years ago. ‘We were 2-1 up (against Crystal Palace) with seven minutes to go and needed a draw. In the most horrific seven minutes in the history of the club they scored twice. Crystal Palace players celebrate Kevin Phillips' goal as Peterborough were relegated from the Championship . Then manager Ferguson consoles Jack Payne after Peterborough threw away a late lead . ‘I was watching from home — I have every game streamed to me. I’m very tense in my chair, superstitious, and my OCD is over the top. You’re not going to make this article about my OCD are you? People will laugh. I was never like this at the start and now it’s uncontrollable. ‘Everything has to be in the same place on my desk and pointing in a certain direction. No-one can talk to me during a game. One of the guys who worked for me walked in and we lost so now no-one is allowed to. ‘When we were relegated I watched and reacted like a fan. Then the financial implications come in. Jesus, we have just lost £6million worth of revenue.’ The logistics of living in the US mean that MacAnthony’s visits to the £500,000 newly-refurbished training ground — rented at £1 a year from the school next door — are regular rather than frequent. Email and telephone have to do the rest of the time. There is a lot to cram in, including this interview. Halfway through there is a knock on the door. ‘I’m busy,’ shouts MacAnthony as the door flies open regardless. ‘I’m doing an interview.’ The beaming face of director of football Barry Fry peers round the door. ‘How you doing love? We need him (MacAnthony). Peterborough director of football Barry Fry interrupts the interview to borrow MacAnthony . During the interview MacAnthony has his picture taken after Michael Bostwick signs a new deal . ‘One minute, one photo. We’re signing a new player love, and there’s nothing more important than that.’ MacAnthony is as helpless as the rest at stopping the irrepressible Fry and a short time-out is called, our photographer in hot pursuit. Back at his desk, the chairman itemises the previous 24 hours, which involved meetings and the signing of six teenagers on pro contracts. The smile fades when the conversation turns to Sir Alex Ferguson’s son Darren, who managed Peterborough twice under MacAnthony. ‘It was tough. It was like losing a member of the family. We spoke every day and we shared the highs and lows. It’s still quite raw. ‘We have to get the next appointment right. The club has been stressing me this season, I have aged. But it’s enjoyable again. I’m in the luxury position that the guys in situ are banging down the door.’ Ferguson left the club for a second time in February - MacAnthony likened it losing a member of the family . MacAnthony and Fry pose together for a picture as the director of football gives the thumbs-up . The new manager will be expected to recruit young, cheap players, produce a winning team and be prepared to lose them as the business plan is one big departure a year — the club have generated £30m of sales under MacAnthony. Britt Assombalonga was the £5m cash cow last year, a record £1m signing from Watford sold on to Nottingham Forest, sparking another angry tweet from @DMAC102 when Forest missed a due payment. There could be new projects in the pipeline. A follow-up book to his first tome, From Hobby to Obsession, perhaps? ‘It was me and a Dictaphone,’ revealed MacAnthony. ‘And then I employed someone to write it. They wrote it badly from an English point of view. ‘The fans liked it and it sold 10,000 but there was nothing about my personal life in there. I haven’t written my autobiography yet — now that would be an interesting book!’",Darragh MacAnthony has been Peterborough chairman for nine years .

"(CNN)The sun cuts across Lake Nicaragua, casting shadows across lush flora and brightly colored boats. Rowing in unison, two girls paddle a canoe to school. Life on Lake Nicaragua is peaceful, rustic and isolated, but this could change with the pending completion of a canal that builders are likening to Panama's famed waterway. Headed by Hong Kong-based consortium HK Nicaragua Canal Development Investment Company (HKND), the $50 billion Nicaragua Canal (also called the Nicaragua Grand Canal and Interoceanic Canal) would create a gargantuan new shipping route through Nicaragua by connecting the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. HKND was granted a 50-year concession by the Nicaraguan government in 2013 to build and operate the 278-kilometer (172 miles) canal, reportedly with the option for an extension. Construction will run from the Rio Punta Gorda on the Caribbean Coast to Brito on the Pacific. At up to 1,700 feet wide and 90 feet deep, the canal, if completed, will be deeper and wider than the Panama Canal. HKND announced the start of construction of the canal with a ceremony on December 22, 2014. The canal will run through Lake Nicaragua (among other areas), Central America's largest lake and freshwater reservoir, which not only preserves an integral part of Nicaragua's ecosystem, but directly supports numerous communities. By some estimates, 30,000 people will have to be relocated to carve a path for the canal. The prospect is nothing short of alarming for those living in the area, and those who cherish its untouched splendor. With the pending completion of the canal in 2019, Lake Nicaragua may be impacted in ways only time will reveal. Environmental experts worry that the shallow waters of the lake won't be able to withstand the dredging that will come with construction. Additionally, communities will likely be displaced and wetlands may become more vulnerable to destruction. ""In terms of the canal impact on Lake Nicaragua, one big concern is the damage to the quality of the water; the ship traffic will pollute the water with toxic sediments and industrial chemicals and introduce destructive invasive species, plants and animals,"" Dr. Jorge A. Huete-Perez, vice president of the Nicaraguan Academy of Sciences and director of the Molecular Biology Center at the University of Central America told CNN. ""Dredging of the lake for the construction of the canal will render the lake a 'dead zone' because of hypoxia, eutrophication and turbidity."" In January, London-based scidev.net reported that an independent commission of experts -- including scientists from the InterAmerican Network of Academies of Science, Nicaraguan Academy of Sciences and International Council for Science -- had reached similar conclusions, warning of ""unintended adverse consequences that could do economic, environmental and social harm."" Like other critics of the canal construction, Huete-Perez wants greater transparency from HKND and the Nicaraguan government. ""This whole thing has been fast-tracked without public consultations or the opportunity for an informed, documented debate,"" said Huete-Perez. On January 9, 2015, HKND responded to concerns about the lake's impact on communities in a statement on its website. ""From July 21 to July 30, 2014, we and our environmental and social impact advisor, Environmental Resources Management (ERM), held scoping meetings across Nicaragua.  Approximately 5,000 people participated in the scoping meetings, including housewives, students, professionals, agricultural producers, fishermen, artisans, businessmen and scholars,"" reads the company's statement, in part. The company says it held a press conference broadcast in real time to the public to announce the route of the canal and comment on the technical, geological, cultural and environmental impact of the project. Some skeptics doubt the hyper-ambitious canal is realistic. Pedro Alvarez, chairman of civil engineering at Rice University, has expressed doubts that it will ever be completed. He worries that it will be abandoned. His greatest concern is severe damage to Lake Nicaragua. Despite the concerns of environmental experts, the project is underway, making a visit to this beautiful area more compelling than ever. Largely unmarred by development, Lake Nicaragua is a sight to behold. During my recent guided visit with Nicaragua Vacations, I took a boat tour through the Islets of Granada, home to 365 scattered islands with majestic views of Mombacho volcano. At times, there was no other boat in sight -- only the rustle of a hidden howler monkey in the bushes and the volcano, ensconced in clouds and morning fog. The feeling of being everywhere and nowhere at once is part of Lake Nicaragua's charm. Another part of its charm is the people who live on it. At Padre Nello School on Lake Nicaragua, about 90 children canoe to school each day. Jicaro Island EcoLodge works with Padre Nello to bring clean water to the children and educational projects that encourage sustainability on the lake. Guests of the lodge can arrange visits. The islets are just southeast of the city of Granada (population approximately 120,000), where colonial buildings defy time, narrow alleyways lead to garden courtyards, charming boutiques are full of local art and street carts overflow with everything from iguanas to cashews. While Granada pulses with Old World charm, Lake Nicaragua stands still with nature as its compass, mostly untouched by modernity. For now. Nicaragua Vacations; +1 866 347 4012 .

"There was real-life drama on the Gold Coast set of the latest Pirates of the Caribbean film when an intruder dressed as Pirate Captain Jack Sparrow brandished a knife at security. The young man broke onto the set wearing an extravagant pirate costume, complete with a live bird, dreadlocks and heavy eye-liner. The impersonator's costume was so convincing he was initially mistaken for one of the film’s extras.

It was initially reported that the wannabe buccaneer brandished a sword. He fled the set into nearby bushland and remains on the run. A sizeable police and dog squad was called to the set but the man and his bird are yet to be remanded. There were reports that he was seen running through nearby Helensvale but it is unknown if he is still dressed in pirate attire.

"Two New York cops that plied an alleged rape victim with alcohol before one attempted to grope her, have admitted to wrongdoing but will get to keep their jobs. The incident occurred when the two NYPD officers, Lukasz Skorzewski, 31, and Lt. Adam Lamboy, 44, flew to Seattle, Washington, to interview an alleged rape victim in July 2013. They ended up buying the 24-year-old rounds of drinks for nine hours, before Skorzewski took her back to their hotel, where he tried to tear off her clothes and grope her. During the encounter he allegedly told her 'You're my favorite victim.' Allegations: The unnamed woman, from Seattle, Washington, alleged that two NYPD officers plied her with rounds of drinks before Skorzewski attempted to grope her . Det. Lukasz Skorzewski, 31, left, and Lt. Adam Lamboy, 44, pleaded guilty to departmental charges after the unidentified 24-year-old woman's allegations made their way to the media. They get to keep their jobs . Both policemen were hit with departmental charges after the unidentified woman's allegations made their way to the media. The two officers pleaded guilty to the charges on Monday, The New York Daily News reported. Skorzewski was demoted from detective after the trip, and was docked 30 vacation days and suspended for 10 days without pay as a result of pleading guilty. He has been transferred to the Medical Division in Queens on a year's probation. 'What the detective did was immoral, certainly. It was wrong. But it wasn't criminal,' a police source told the Daily News. Lamboy was already under investigation for overtime payments that he had not worked. He pleaded guilty to that charge too and was ordered to pay back more than $5,000 for 76 hours. For both charges he was docked 45 vacation days and suspended for 15 without pay. He has been transferred to Police Service Area 9 Viper in Flushing, Queens, a public housing unit. Lamboy lost his command as head of the NYPD's Manhattan Special Victims Division. Police Commissioner Bill Bratton will have to approve the final punishment. Sonia Ossorio, president of the National Organization for Women's New York City chapter, said in a statement: 'The idea of a special victims detective making a pass at a rape victim when he's charged with interviewing her about that rape shatters any notion of confidence in the NYPD's ability to regulate itself.' 'It's so far beyond the bounds of acceptability.' The alleged victim said that on the day of the incident she had lunch with Skorzewski, a married father of two, at a Seattle restaurant called the Skillet Diner. He spent time asking questions about her January 2013 rape case in which she alleges she was attacked by a man in a Union Square apartment in New York City. She was then taken to the Pier 58 tourist area to meet his boss, Lamboy. Sonia Ossorio of the National Organization for Women's New York chapter, says the case shatters  confidence in the NYPD's ability to regulate itself . She told The New York Daily News: 'Looking back, it was totally naive of me to join them. But I was like, 'This is really cool.' I really looked up to them.' 'Luke was actually the one who said, 'I don't know if you're going to be able to come because we're going to be drinking. 'But when I dropped him off, the lieutenant was the one who said, 'Oh, no, you should stay, come on,' she recalled. 'I was going through this all alone. My family didn't know,' she said. 'It felt good that they were being so nice.' They then went to Paddy Coyne's Irish Pub, but Skorzewski was so drunk that servers refused to give him any more alcohol. Later, they headed to Cha Cha Lounge in Capitol Hill and then moved on to Unicorn, with the cops flashing their badges to cut the line. She said that she attempted to leave at around midnight, but they begged her to stay. They even pleaded with her to call in sick to her job as a Starbucks barista the next morning. She was drunk and unable to drive, so she went with them after they assured her that she would be safe if she stayed with them at their hotel. They  took her back to their hotel room at the Embassy Suites hotel in nearby Bellevue, Washington. Once there, Skorzewski loaned her some clothes and slept on the couch, she said. But when they woke up with hangovers, Skorzewski climbed in bed with her as they watched TV and  asked to put his arm around her. She claims he said: 'I really want to kiss you right now.' He also wanted to 'feel her up.' She describes how he tried to work his way into her pants to tear them off but she pushed his hand away. The next day, both policemen visited her at Starbucks and promised to stay in touch. Pub: The accuser claimed Skorzewski had been so drunk that servers at an Irish bar in downtown Seattle refused to give him any more alcohol . She said Skorzewski called her almost daily from New York for a month but the calls soon stopped, and she was 'crushed.' She quizzed him about why he had become distant in an e-mail but he became angry suggesting that she had screwed up his personal life. She later saw Skorzewski in New York in October 2013 for a 'call' to the man who allegedly attacked her in January of that year. But the man was never charged. Skorzewski soon stopped returning her calls altogether, so she  sent a letter to a family friend in the NYPD which led to a call from the Internal Affairs Bureau. She told Internal affairs what happened and gave them evidence, including photos from the boozy night out, text messages and phone records which showed two-hour long calls with Skorzewski. Shortly after her claims were partially vindicated, Lamboy and Skorzewski were transferred from the elite Manhattan Special Victims Division. Today, the woman, who is now now studying nursing at a Manhattan university, says she feels guilty that the detective might lose his job.","The policemen pleaded guilty to the departmental charges and received docked pay and vacation days and were reassigned .

"Women with vaginal piercings are to be classed as victims of female genital mutilation (FGM), health chiefs have said . Women with vaginal piercings are to be classed as victims of female genital mutilation (FGM), health chiefs have said. Under new NHS rules to be introduced next month, any woman whose labia or clitoris has been pierced must be recorded as suffering FGM, a procedure which is illegal in the UK. The mandatory reporting regulations were sent to medical staff by the Department of Health, which said it is would start classifying the piercings 'within an abusive context'. It means that even women who have consented to the piercing for cosmetic reasons will be deemed as a potential victim of crime. Those responsible for carrying out the piercing could also be implicated for committing a criminal offence. The new rules are in line with guidance from the World Health Organisation, which last year classified piercing as 'harmful procedures' that are considered under the bracket of FGM. There is already much debate about whether genital surgery procedures such as so-called 'designer vagina' operations should be treated by as FGM. Last week, MPs released a report which said police, midwives and campaigners remain confused over whether the operations fall within FGM laws. Under the Female Genital Mutilation Act 2003, it is illegal to cut girls' genitals unless there is a genuine justification. The exemptions in the Female Genital Mutilation Act 2003 refer to operations carried out on the grounds of physical or mental health and do not cover cosmetic surgery. The Home Affairs Select Committee said the act should be amended to reiterate that female genital cosmetic surgery on those who do not have a physical or mental health justification is potentially illegal. The Government has previously said it has no plans to make these changes. Some 170,000 women and girls are estimated to be living with FGM in the UK. More than 2,600 women and girls who went through FGM have been treated by the NHS since last September, with 499 women and girls with FGM seen in acute NHS trusts in England in January alone. More than 200 FGM-related cases were investigated by the police nationally in the past five years. A Department of Health man said: 'While there are challenges in this area and adult women may have genital piercings, in some communities girls are forced to have them. The World Health Organisation has quite rightly defined this as a form of FGM. 'We are taking every precaution to record genital piercings that have been done within an abusive context. 'The new data collection will help build a picture of the scale and the nature of the problem we are facing. We are continually working on ways to improve and develop the NHS response to this terrible practice.'",New NHS rules will apply to any woman whose labia or clitoris is pierced . Even women who  consented to piercing will be potential victims of crime . Mandatory reporting regulations sent to medics by Government chiefs .

"The king of Saudi Arabia has handed his country's most-prestigious prize to a preacher who has previously said the Koran allows Muslims to have sex with female slaves. Indian cleric Zakir Naik, who has also said 9/11 was an inside job, was handed the King Faisal International Prize for Services to Islam at a glittering ceremony in Riyadh. A physician by training, the Mumbai-based 49-year-old has carved out a career as a charismatic television preacher, but his controversial views have led to him being banned from entering the UK. And the winner is... Saudi King Salman bin Abdul Aziz presents Zakir Naik, president of the Islamic Research Foundation in India, with the 2015 King Faisal International Prize for Service to Islam . Dr Naik was one of five winners presented a gold medal, a certificate hand written in Arabic calligraphy and an endowment of more than £130,000 by Saudi King Salman during a ceremony at a luxury hotel yesterday. The president of the Islamic Research Foundation in India, Dr Naik was honoured for being one of the most renowned non-Arabic speaking promoters of Islam. He founded the Peace TV channel, billed as the world's only channel specialising in comparative religion, which now reaches an estimated English-language audience exceeding 100million, according to his award citation. 'Islam is the only religion that can bring peace to the whole of humanity,' he said in a video biography aired at the ceremony. It was on a broadcast on Peace TV that Dr Naik suggested that Muslims men may rape their slaves. 'There are many verses in the Koran which say you can have sex with your wife and with whatever your right hand possesses,' he told a mass audience at one event. 'Right hand possesses,' he went on. 'Which means your slaves.' He goes on to qualify his statement by saying the world at the time of the Prophet Mohammed was beset by war, making slavery more common, and that a pious Muslim would marry the slave he wanted to have sex with first. But the remark seems to be a disturbing echo of the doctrines of the Middle East's Islamic State insurgency. Last October, the terror group published an article on its propaganda page stating that the sexual enslavement of captured Yazidis was justified because they are a 'pagan minority'. 'Enslaving the families of the kuffar (non-believers) and taking their women as concubines is a firmly established aspect of the Sharia,' the article pronounced. Inside the Islamic State: Last October, the terror group published an article on its propaganda page stating that the sexual enslavement of captured Yazidis was justified because they are a 'pagan minority' 'Inside job': Dr Naik has claimed the then-President George W Bush was behind the September 11 attacks . Dr Naik's controversial comments have extended beyond sexual politics. In a July 2008 Peace TV broadcast he suggested that Al-Qaeda was not responsible for flying hijacked airliners into New York's World Trade Center on September 11, 2001, killing almost 3,000 people. 'Even a fool will know that this was an inside job,' he said in the video, claiming then-President George W. Bush was behind the attacks. In 2010 Dr Naik was barred from entering Britain after the Home Secretary cited 'numerous comments' which showed his 'unacceptable behaviour'. During his acceptance speech at Riyadh's Al Faisaliah Hotel last night, Dr Naik told dignitaries he would be donating his prize money to Peace TV. The annual prizes are a project of the King Faisal Foundation, established in 1976 by the children of King Faisal bin Abdul Aziz who died in 1975. The other prize winners were: .

"The remains of a woolly mammoth that died 10,000 years ago have been unearthed in Siberia by oil workers. Two tusks, teeth and rib bones of the extinct giant mammal were discovered buried three metres down in the frozen soil around 31 miles (50km) from Nyagan in Khanty-Mansi, Russia. Oil workers had been digging at a site owned by Rosneft close to the town when they noticed a tusk sticking out of the excavator bucket. Ancient: Two mammoth tusks (shown above) together with fragments of jaw, teeth, tibia and ribs were dug from the frozen soil of Siberia. Oil workers noticed a tusk sticking out of the excavator bucket . Using shovels they then unearthed a second tust, a tibia, ribs, teeth and fragments of the animal's jaw. Aton Rezvy, head of palaeontology at the Khanty-Mansiysk Museum of Nature and Man, said he believes the mammoth is at least 10,000 years old. Since the 1700s scientists have debated what caused the demise of mammoths. All but a few isolated island populations disappeared between 20,000 and 10,000 years ago. One popular theory, bolstered by this study, is that Ice Age people hunted most of the mammoths out of existence. However, some experts argue that global warming helped make the giant creatures extinct between 20,000 and 25,000 years ago. Other researchers argue that an impact of extraterritorial objects in North America 13,000 years ago, led to rapid climate change, eventually wiping out the mammoths. Today, it's thought that a combination of factors led to extinction. He estimated that the giant animal had been a fully grown adult female, around 30 to 40 years old when she died. He said they hoped to conduct further analysis of the bones to learn more about the mammoth. He told the Siberian Times: 'We can send the find to determine the radiocarbon date. 'Genetic analysis will help to determine which population this mammoth was from - European or North American.' Recent research has shown that many woolly mammoths discovered in Siberia may have originated in North Ameria and migrated across the Bering Strait when sea levels were lower. Many believe the original Siberian population of mammoths disappeared around 40,000 years ago, with North American mammoths dominating until around 4,500 years ago. The exact reason for their extinction is still debated with many blaming changes to the climate as causing their demise. Others have pointed to evidence that humans and neanderthals hunted the giant creatures along with other ice age megafauna and may have pushed them to the brink of extinction. Palaeontologists who examined the mammoth's remains (shown above) estimate it died 10,000 years ago . Oil workers had been excavating a site 31 miles from Nyagan in Russia (above) when they found the mammoth. They estimate that the giant had been a fully grown female, around 30 to 40 years old . A recent study has suggested that human hunting caused a massive drop in mammoth populations in western Europe around 30,000 years ago. Just a few isolated populations of mammoth are though to have clung on. Dozens of mammoth remains have been unearthed in Siberia, including entire skeletons and even mummified bodies still preserved in the ice. The mammoth's remains were unearthed about 30 miles from the town of Nyagan in Khanty-Mansi, Russia . Vladimir Bednyakov (pictured above) had been operating the digger when he unearthed the mammoth tusks . Vladimir Bednyakov was operating the excavator when he discovered the latest mammoth. He said: 'I noticed something in the excavator bucket. It turned to be a mammoth tusk. 'We have the rule - if we find something, we stop the work and call the bosses. 'But I was also interested myself, in what this was. 'I took the shovel and began to dig.... found more remains, the second tusk, teeth and other bones.'

"(CNN)Many years ago, a colleague told me how frustrated her husband was by ""Amazon Mom,"" a special membership program offered by the retail giant that provides discounts, recommendations and other information to help parents during the crazy toddler years. In bold print, the company says the program is ""open to anyone, whether you're a mom, dad, grandparent, or caretaker."" But still it is called ""Amazon Mom,"" irking my colleague's husband to no end since he was the one ordering the majority of diapers and other products for their babies. 'Dad' gets a makeover in Super Bowl ads . My friend's husband was not alone. A petition created a few years ago calls on Amazon to change the name of the program from ""Amazon Mom"" to ""Amazon Family."" But the drive didn't get much traction. That changed after the recent death of a beloved dad blogger, Oren Miller, who created a Facebook group for dad bloggers in 2012 that has grown to more than 1,000 members. In 2013, Miller called on men and women to sign the petition to get Amazon to change the name of the program. ""Why did Amazon bother changing the name of its parenting program when the program started in the UK? What made them realize they couldn't get away with calling it 'Amazon Mom,' and why do they get away with it here?"" Miller wrote. ""Someone actually started a petition to change the name to 'Amazon Family' in the US, and so far it has less than 100 signatures. Why is that? Why are we OK with letting England be more progressive than we are here when it comes to fatherhood? They have a queen! They are ruled by a freakin' queen! We can do better than that!"" he wrote. No more dumb old dad: Changing the bumbling father stereotype . I had the pleasure of interviewing Miller for a story last year on whether modern dads get enough credit. The 42-year-old stay-at-home father of two, who fought perceptions of fathers as nothing more than babysitters in essays on his blog, was diagnosed with lung cancer in 2014. Miller, of Owings Mills, Maryland, died Saturday. Now, members of the dad blogging community are rallying in his honor, trying to step up the pressure on the Internet powerhouse to finally change the name of its program and get with the times. Mike Heenan, a stay-at-home father of two in Northern California and founder of the blog At-Home Dad Matters, never got to meet Miller but says that when Miller welcomed him into his community of dad bloggers, it changed his life. ""He got me writing again, inspired me to publish, to contribute, to tell my story ... to be a better dad for my daughters."" Heenan, like several other dad bloggers, took to Twitter using the #AmazonFamilyUS hashtag to call for Amazon to make the change. ""The push for inclusivity in the parenting arena has been well received by many a brand in the past few years and, like Oren, many of us think the change to 'Amazon Family' is a no-brainer,"" Heenan said. Judgy moms and dads face off in hit ad . Buzz Bishop, a father of two in Calgary, Alberta, and founder of the blog Dad Camp, points out how Amazon calls its program ""Amazon Family"" in Germany, Japan, Austria, France and Canada as well as the United Kingdom. ""So why is it called 'Amazon Mom' in America?"" Bishop wrote in a blog post. ""We are continuing a cause that was once championed by the creator of the Dad Bloggers Facebook group, Oren Miller,"" wrote Bishop. ""In his name, we want to finish the job."" The petition has gotten over 4,800 signatures. Amazon has not commented on the movement. In the meantime, Miller's supporters won't stop pushing. I hope they never do.

"We've divided the Premier League into teams from the north and south of England - with Welsh side Swansea included in the south. Joe Bernstein had the choice to pick any players from the north, in any formation, with no limit on how many from each club. Rob Draper picked his South XI on Monday, and you can read that here. Here's how we split the clubs: . South . Arsenal, Aston Villa, Chelsea, Crystal Palace, Leicester City, QPR, Southampton, Swansea City, Spurs, West Brom, West Ham United . North . Burnley, Everton, Hull City, Liverpool, Manchester City, Manchester United, Newcastle United, Stoke City, Sunderland . North vs South. It is perhaps the fiercest argument between the people of England. But without dipping into the political allegiances, property prices and weather, we're sticking to the ultimate debating point – football. This week we are starting a new North vs South debate - who would you pick and who would win? In the NBA, each season they stage an All-Star match that pits the best from the West against the cream of the East. And wouldn't it be fascinating if the Premier League adopted a similar event? Yesterday, Rob Draper selected his South XI. Here, Joe Bernstein reveals his North XI - plus seven subs. Then on Wednesday, we'll reveal who would win the match thanks to our friends at Football Manager. And, as always, we want you to tell us who you would have picked in your team... Goalkeeper: Joe Hart (Manchester City) Tough call between David de Gea and Hart, but the City stopper is better at organising his defenders and more commanding in the air. And, as he showed against Lionel Messi, he can stop a penalty too. Right back: Daryl Janmaat (Newcastle United) Been outstanding this season and Toon fans will have an anxious wait this summer to see if a bigger club snaps him up. Janmaat can also play in the centre of the defence but he's most threatening down the right where his crosses would cause havoc to any rearguard. Creative player too. Centre half: Ryan Shawcross (Stoke City) Would surely have been an England regular if he played for a more glamorous club than Stoke. Better than Gary Cahill or Phil Jagielka, less injury-prone than Phil Jones. This team is so crammed with attacking talent, the two centre-halves are in purely to defend. And they're good at that. Joe Hart has been superb in the league and showed against Barcelona he can do it in Europe too . Daryl Janmaat has been outstanding this season and Newcastle fans will have an anxious wait this summer . Ryan Shawcross pictured scoring for Stoke City against Manchester United at the Britannia Stadium . Centre half: Martin Skrtel (Liverpool) Totally fearless, he keeps putting his head and body in the way of danger - just what you want from a centre-half. Useful in both penalty areas at set-pieces too, he gets his fair share of goals for a defender. Him and Shawcross wouldn't let anything pass, allowing the two full backs to push up. Left back: Leighton Baines (Everton) Just gets better and better with age. Fantastic at set-pieces, both delivery and shooting, and so calm on the ball. Has got over the disappointment of not joining Manchester United and it's no coincidence Everton hit their dodgy patch when he was out of the team injured. Right wing: Raheem Sterling (Liverpool) Showed at the last World Cup he has now taken over Wayne Rooney's mantle as the best player in the England team and it's hard to believe he is still only 20. The one player in Roy Hodgson's squad that you think could actually make it with Real Madrid or Barcelona, he is quick, skilful, has natural balance and courage on and off the ball . Liverpool's totally fearless defender Martin Skrtel (right) squares up to David de Gea at Anfield recently . Everton's Leighton Baines just seems to get better and better with age in the demanding Premier League . Raheem Sterling has become an brilliant performer for Liverpool this season as they look to tie him down . Central midfield: Michael Carrick (Manchester United) People ask why Manchester United's form has improved in the last couple of matches. Simple, Michael Carrick is back from injury and making the team tick. Always seems to know when to play the right pass, and makes average players around him look good and the good players look great . Central midfield: James McCarthy (Everton) If this team has steel down the middle in Skrtel and Shawcross, and stealth in Carrick, McCarthy adds speed. He can cover ground to make tackles and when he needs to use the ball, the Irishman is neat and tidy. One of Roberto Martinez's best signings and no wonder bigger clubs want him. Left midfield: David Silva (Manchester City) With Leighton Baines behind him, Silva wouldn't have to hug the left-hand touchline like a traditional winger, he would start from there, link up with Baines at times but also drift inside and drop grenades infield. On his day, a hugely talented and influential player. Juan Mata is rightly getting plaudits at the moment, in Spain they say Silva is better. Michael Carrick has returned from injury and is making Manchester United tick for manager Louis van Gaal . James McCarthy, pictured scoring for Everton against Newcastle United at Goodison Park, makes the XI . David Silva (above) and Manchester City team-mate Sergio Aguero make it into our North XI . Striker: Sergio Aguero (Manchester City) Has taken over Luis Suarez's mantle as the best player in the league. Absolutely lethal against any type of opposition as his hat-trick against Bayern Munich showed in the Champions League. May be asked to leave the penalties to Leighton Baines though after his fluffed effort in the Nou Camp. Striker: Wayne Rooney (captain) (Manchester United) Rooney has often formed good strike partnerships with players who are of similar build and technique, Henrik Larsson springs to mind in his brief spell at Manchester United, so I have no doubts he would be prolific with Sergio Aguero. I can see them being on the same wavelength and Rooney would spot the Argentine's runs early. Wayne Rooney captains our North XI for his outstanding form for Louis van Gaal's Manchester United .

Pablo Zabaleta (Manchester City): If you need someone to see out the final 20 minutes, he's perfect.

Yaya Toure (Manchester City): Totally unpredictable, if you don't know how he's going to play, how can the opposition? Ashley Young (Manchester United): Coming into some great form, can play right or left, and will track back when needed. Daniel Sturridge (Liverpool): A great impact sub, can score in instant with his quick feet . Robin van Persie (Manchester United): Been written off this season, but it's less than a year ago he scored that header in World Cup.

"Wolfsburg midfielder Kevin de Bruyne is a transfer target for Bundesliga champions Bayern Munich. The former Chelsea man has been in sensational form this season, bagging nine goals and 17 assists in 26 appearances while helping steer Wolfsburg to second in the German league. De Bruyne is contracted to Wolfsburg until 2019 but, according to newspaper Sport Bild, Bayern are keeping tabs on the Belgian as Pep Guardiola's side look to line up a long-term successor to Arjen Robben, who is out of contract in 2017.

The Belgian international (right) has scored nine goals in 26 appearances for Wolfsburg so far this season . Bild also report that Bayern may wait until the summer of 2016 to make a move for De Bruyne, who they believe is currently worth around £35million on current form. Meanwhile, De Bruyne's Wolfsburg team-mate Marcel Schafer has urged the 23-year-old to stay for at least another season. He told reporters: 'I think that our chances [of keeping De Bruyne] are really good. He has already experienced not getting so much time on the field at Chelsea, a top club in Europe. Jose Mourinho deemed De Bruyne surplus to requirements at Stamford Bridge last year . 'And that is why I think the best thing for him would be to stay for minimum one more year at Wolfsburg. Next year he could play Champions League here and win titles with us. 'If you want to win titles you need extraordinary players. And you really have to say that Kevin de Bruyne is at the moment the best player in the Bundesliga not only because of his stats. You can see that in every single game.

"(CNN)Tunisia's tourism industry has been thrown into disarray by a terror attack on Wednesday that left at least 17 foreign visitors dead and prompted urgent warnings over security. Only just recovering from the impact of the Arab Spring uprisings four years ago, Tunisia has once again emerged as a winter sun draw for tens of thousands of travelers. But following Wednesday's attack and siege at the prestigious Bardo Museum in central Tunis, the country's tourism industry is once again facing jeopardy even as authorities and operators scramble to ensure the safety of visitors currently in the country. A significant number of foreign tourists were inside the museum at the time of the attack, which government officials said was the work of ""Islamists."" Prime Minister Habib Essid said Polish, Italian, German and Spanish tourists are among those killed, with another 20 tourists plus two Tunisians wounded in the attack. MSC Cruises said its ship, MSC Splendida, is currently docked in the Tunis port of La Goulette and some of its passengers had been on tours of the city, including the Bardo at the time of the attack. ""All the tourist coaches on tour were immediately recalled to the port and all other tours on the ground were immediately suspended,"" MSC said in a statement. Another ship, the Costa Fascinosa, docked in Tunis at that time, has a manifest of more than 3,000 passengers, its parent company Costa Cruise said. As details of the incident emerged, several foreign governments put out warnings urging their citizens to stay away from the scene of the attacks, around an area that includes the national parliament building. The U.S. Embassy in Tunis issued an alert that also reiterated standing advice about the potential for violence in Tunisia and the risk of kidnappings. Its warning cautions against trips to Tunisia's central, southern and border regions. Britain's Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) also urged UK citizens to stay away from the affected areas of Tunis and to ""follow the instructions of Tunisian security authorities."" Its warning also carried longstanding advice: ""There is a high threat from terrorism, including kidnapping. Attacks could be indiscriminate, including places visited by foreigners."" With tens of thousands of foreign visitors likely to be in Tunisia right now and many more contemplating travel there, travel operators have been rushing to formulate a response to the attack. It's not immediately known if flights will be added to accommodate any sudden surge in departures or whether tour operators will pull out of the country -- responses that followed a terror attack in Kenya last year. Thomson and First Choice, a UK-based travel operator that carries thousands of vacationers on package trips to Tunisia, said it had canceled organized excursions to Tunis as a precaution. A statement said it would follow FCO advice, which overall remained unchanged for Tunisia. ""Thomson and First Choice customers stay in beach destinations, not Tunis, and we can confirm that none of our customers or staff were affected by the incident that took place there today,"" it said. ""As a precaution however we have canceled excursions to Tunis for the coming days. ""Customer safety is of paramount importance to us and we continue to work closely with the FCO and the British Consulate to monitor the situation. Tunisia remains a popular destination for us and customers are enjoying their holidays as normal."" In its advisory, the UK Foreign Office points out ""424,707 British nationals visited Tunisia in 2014. Most British tourists stay in the coastal resorts and most visits are trouble free."" Indeed, Tunisia's largely unsullied reputation as a safe north African destination for Europeans seeking low coast beach breaks has clawed back some of the popularity it enjoyed before 2011. In 2010, the country welcomed 6.9 million tourists to its beach resorts and numerous historic sites. In 2011, the year in which an uprising ousted longtime President Zine al-Abidine Ben Ali -- an event credited with triggering the Arab Spring -- that number fell below 4.8 million. With calm restored in recent years -- despite security concerns from neighboring Libya and ongoing political tensions -- those numbers have been on the rise, helped by costly advertising campaigns. Recently reported statistics put visitor numbers still 10% lower than their pre-2011 levels, but numbers had been expected to rise again -- particularly with a new ""Star Wars"" film renewing interest in the country's role as a key location in the original movies. In a 2013 interview, Tunisian tourism minister Jamel Gamra said up to 20% of Tunisia's population -- equivalent to 2 million people -- relied on the tourism industry. He told the Inter Press Service he was optimistic that visitor numbers would continue to grow. ""The sector has big potential and we aim to reach 10 million tourists by 2016, a growth of one million tourists per year,"" he said. ""Tunisia also has more freedom and democracy now, which is very important for economic growth and prosperity and has a positive effect on the tourism industry.""","Gunmen killed 17 tourists and two others on Wednesday at a museum in Tunisia's capital . U.S., UK and other foreign governments have issued travel warnings . Tourism numbers had been increasing in Tunisia in recent years, following downturn after 2011 Arab Spring unrest .",254a5048a23f600c0642706e0508a3ff7c324b4c

"A pregnant model, who is less a month away from giving birth, has come under fire from her Instagram followers after sharing a series of saucy lingerie-clad selfies flaunting her barely-there baby-bump. Sarah Stage, a 30-year-old underwear model and animal rights activist, has documented her changing figure via her Instagram page throughout her pregnancy earning herself a huge number of fans in the process. However, as her pregnancy has progressed, more and more people have begun criticizing the mother-to-be, claiming that her unusually trim and toned figure could be doing damage to her unborn child.

Mom-to-be: Sarah Stage, a Los Angeles-based lingerie model, has been documenting her changing pregnancy body and many of her 1.1m Instagram followers cannot believe she is eight months pregnant . Another added: 'Feed the baby! She's just cares about her looks, not the growing of the baby. So sad that the baby [will be] so tiny when he comes into the world.' The model’s pictures have garnered thousands more similar comments, many of which criticize her for being 'unhealthy' and unnaturally small for a pregnant woman. But while Sarah has faced her fair share of criticisms, others were more complimentary with their comments. 'Everyone is body shaming her. It’s really sad how quick everyone is to judge her and say that she is starving her baby, before actually educating yourselves on why she may look so small,' one person wrote. Proud: Sarah refuses to hide her eight month pregnant body in maternity clothes and prefers to flaunt it in lingerie . Meanwhile, another fan noted: 'Cuteset bump ever!' Despite her critics, Sarah refuses to hide her eight-month pregnant body in maternity clothes and prefers to flaunt it on social media for the world to see. Sarah, who is of European and Costa Rican descent and lives in Los Angeles, shuns baggy dresses and instead dresses her bump in fitted Lycra or nothing at all. The fitness fanatic loves hitting the gym and captures herself working out, as well as following a healthy diet of quinoa, spinach and chicken.

Gym bunny: The model credits her svelte figure to her regular work-out sessions in the gym . 'The hormones are elevated during pregnancy and women react differently to the hormones. 'Some women are particularly sensitive to elevated hormones and suffer with symptoms, whereas others sail through without any symptoms.' Dr Venkat added that a woman's height plays a role and the taller a woman is can help her carry herself with better posture than a shorter woman. When it comes to working out, she says, women generally don't need to worry about staying in shape during pregnancy. Citing walking and gentle stretching as the best exercises during pregnancy, she says women are going to be exhausted in the first couple of weeks after delivery and can start exercising after a fortnight, once a routine is established.

"Cheltenham have appointed Gary Johnson as manager until the end of the season.

"Patrick Strudwick had a tumour removed from his large intestine seven years ago, aged 30 . The question, at first glance, seems fairly simple: would you want to know your chances of getting cancer? In particular, whether you are carrying a faulty gene (or even several) that could make cancerous cells or a malignant tumour more likely. But when the opportunity arose to have genetic screening to find out if my DNA was flawed, this question merely triggered more: how would I cope if it turned out cancer was a near certainty? Though certain genetic tests are available on the NHS for people with a clear family history of a particular cancer — for example, if more than two members of your immediate family have had it — the private Spire Bushey Hospital, in Hertfordshire, has become the first to offer full screening for a range of cancers to people who may have had only one or two family members affected. Some genes they test for, in particular the faulty BRCA1 and BRCA2, have received a lot of publicity in recent years. Angelina Jolie discovered she carried a faulty copy of BRCA1, and singer Michelle Heaton found she had a mutated version of BRCA2. They opted for double mastectomies and hysterectomies to avoid the 60 to 90 per cent chance of developing cancer. But this new service screens for dozens of different genes linked to prostate, bowel, breast and ovarian cancers, which are among the most common in Britain, using ‘next generation’ gene technology to provide a full range of results within 12 weeks. There were various reasons why I decided to give it a go. Seven years ago, aged 30, I was lying in a hospital bed, heavily sedated after a colonoscopy to find the cause of months of abdominal pain, when my gastroenterologist delivered the news: . ‘We found an adenoma — a type of tumour — in your large intestine. It was about an inch long, but we managed to remove it.’ ‘OK,’ I replied from the fog of sedation. Though the tumour was benign, the doctor added: ‘The type means that it would likely have become malignant. Had we not removed this, you could have been dead by 40.’ Because such growths are rare for someone so young, I was told I would need to have colonoscopies every three years to (hopefully) catch any further abnormalities. Three years later, a scan found another polyp — smaller, benign, but still, more reason to worry. Another year on and I was lying in another bed, my own, when the telephone rang. ‘They found some cancerous cells,’ my father began. It was his prostate, a common cancer in older men (he was 67) and one with pretty good prospects for survival. But his uncle — my grandfather’s brother — had died of it. And my father’s tumour was one of the most aggressive kinds. He made a full recovery, but the worries lingered. Could there be a faulty prostate cancer gene on my father’s side? My mother was adopted and knows nothing of her family, so might there be bowel cancer genes on her side? Could there be two loaded guns waiting for me? Patrick (pictured) decided to have genetic screening for cancer to find out whether or not he is predisposed to particular strains of bowel and prostate cancer . The final push to take the tests came down to the memory of a dear friend called Beth. Gorgeous, fiercely clever, with a wonderful family and a promising career ahead, she died from malignant melanoma — skin cancer — on her back in 1999. She was 26. So, if there was anything I could do to catch cancer before it caught me, I’d do it, I decided. I booked an appointment with the hospital’s genetic counsellor, Vicki Kiesel. Her hour-long assessment included umpteen questions: ages of siblings, who’d had children, ages of grand- parents at death, who’d had which cancers and when; my medical history, why I wanted screening. Vicki was most concerned about the adenoma. ‘If there is anything in your family to watch for, it would be something called Lynch syndrome,’ she told me. ‘It’s a genetic mistake that makes people more likely to get bowel cancer. With it comes an increased risk of prostate cancer.’ Lynch syndrome can also trigger endometrial, stomach, ovary, brain and skin cancers. If I did have this gene, how great would be the risk of bowel cancer? ‘Up to about 70 per cent,’ she said. Spotting my panicked expression, she told me there were several things they would do to reduce the risks: ‘Colonoscopies every 18 months or so to catch any polyps before they become malignant, and daily aspirin.’ (A recent review of studies on aspirin by Queen Mary University of London concluded that a daily low dose for ten years can reduce the risk of colon cancer by 35 per cent.) ‘After the age of 40 we would also suggest regular PSA tests for prostate cancer,’ she said. If I had Lynch syndrome, my siblings would have a 50 per cent chance of having it, too, so I’d need to tell them. However, Vicki also explained that only 5 to 10 per cent of cancer occurs because of genes — most cancers have an environmental cause. And Lynch syndrome accounts for only 2 to 3 per cent of bowel cancer. The problem, I feel, with all of these statistics is this: they mean nothing if you are one of the few per cent affected. I opted to have screening for every gene we so far know about that can trigger prostate or bowel cancer — 12 genes in total — and went to have the blood taken. For the next ten weeks I refused to think about it, pretended it wasn’t happening and told no one. When I received an email from the clinic saying my results were back and did I want them in person or over the phone, I froze, completely unable to decide. Angelina Jolie (left) discovered she carried a faulty copy of BRCA1, and singer Michelle Heaton (right) found she had a mutated version of BRCA2, they both opted for double mastectomies and hysterectomies . I chickened out and asked for a phone appointment. During the few days before the call, I spoke to Colin Elton, a consultant colorectal surgeon at the Spire Bushey Hospital, to find out his take on how useful these tests might be. ‘There’s not enough awareness among GPs and hospital doctors of the benefits of genetic testing,’ he said. ‘Even if someone does have a family history of one type of cancer, and if they are sent to a genetic counsellor by the NHS, they still might not have the actual testing if the counsellor doesn’t think the chances are high enough. ‘But this screening gives people who might have only one parent or sibling the chance to test — and it’s one of the most common questions family members of cancer patients have: “will I get it, too?” ’ In fact, the NHS might not offer testing because only a small percentage of cancers are caused by genetic problems, says Shane McKee, a consultant clinical geneticist at the Belfast Health and Social Care Trust. He also casts doubt on the screening you can pay for outside the NHS, as family history does not need to be as strong in order to get the tests, which makes analysing the results harder. Another problem is there are likely to be 200 genes responsible for a significant risk of cancer, but we know of only half of them. Patrick (pictured) was incredibly relieved to learn that his genetic screening came back normal although he says he will do everything he can to lower the risks of cancer . Cancer Research UK also advises caution around genetic screening. ‘Knowing that you have certain genetic faults doesn’t always mean there’s any action you can take,’ says a spokesman. But Dr McKee is clear about the benefits of specific genetic cancer tests, particularly for bowel and breast cancers. ‘The objective is to see if we can identify people at increased risk at an early stage, so we can put surveillance programmes in place. Most cancers are treatable if they are caught at an early stage.’ It was this risk reduction that made any lingering doubts about taking the test vanish. I braced myself. Vicki rang with the news. ‘We’ve looked at the 12 genes and they’re all normal.’ ‘Thank God,’ I replied. As I hung up, the relief was almost overwhelming. Later, though, I reminded myself that this only puts me back to similar levels of cancer risk to anyone else and that I might still have a cancer-causing gene we don’t yet know about. I must still do what we all should to lower the risks: keep my weight down, restrict alcohol, don’t smoke and take exercise. I must remain vigilant — for me, for my family and for Beth.",Patrick Strudwick had an intestinal tumour removed  seven years ago . Four years later his father was diagnosed with prostate cancer . Patrick had genetic screening that tests for different types of the disease . His results were returned normal but he will remain vigilant from now on .,169c0a47644156a499fd8b546a55ccf23ecadea2
"A five-year-old boy has been left traumatised after he was lured behind a building at his school and attacked by five  classmates before being made to face them again  just an hour later. Ewan Potter was kicked and punched in the playground of Living Faith Lutheran Primary School at Murrumba Downs in Brisbane's north two weeks ago. He was left with some 'cracking bruises' and clear psychological effects, but his father Anthony says the young boys responsible got away with just a slap on the wrist. Ewan Potter was kicked and punched in the playground of Living Faith Lutheran Primary School at Murrumba Downs in Brisbane's north two weeks ago . Mr Potter was told by the school the group of boys - aged five and six - organised for the on-duty teacher to be distracted so they could carry out the attack on February 26. 'Ewan told me he was tricked into playing with the boys. They lured him behind the building and when he tried to run away they chased him and caught him,' Mr Potter told Daily Mail Australia. 'They dragged him back and started kicking and punching. 'The bruises are still there on his knees. He had a couple on his arms and chest. Luckily he didn't have any broken bones or blood gushing out.' His parents were only notified of the incident several hours after it happened because the school tried to sort out the situation using a method known as 'restorative practice'. 'They made Ewan go back to face all five boys so they could see what the bullying had done to him - how traumatic is that?' he said. 'He went to sleep that night with a stick to protect himself. I sat on the floor of his bedroom.' Ewan was left with some 'cracking bruises' and clear psychological effects, but his father Anthony (right) says the young boys responsible got away with just a slap on the wrist . Ewan, pictured here with his sister, was kicked and punched behind a school building by five young boys . Four of the boys remained in the same class with Ewan the next day, while the little boy who admitted to being 'the boss of the group' was moved to another classroom. 'It's gang violence. I can't believe six-year-olds can be pre-meditating attacks like this. One admitted to being the boss and getting four others involved,' Mr Potter said. The parents of all five children were called in and given behavioural orders  to work on at home, while age-appropriate consequences were enforced at school. Principal Jane Mueller said the school  had taken swift action and were 'saddened' by the bullying. 'I fully understand the concerns of parents of any child impacted by such an incident, and by the same token, I'm also conscious of our responsibility to teach these very young students at the infancy of their school career what is right and wrong,' she told the Courier Mail. Ewan's parents were only notified of the incident several hours after it happened because the school tried to sort out the situation using a method known as 'restorative practice' Ms Mueller said  the boys involved were still being monitored in the playground and consequences were being implemented at home with the support of parents. 'No matter what these parents do at home to help them, these kids have got away with a slap on the wrist. If we keep letting them get away with violence, how is it going to stop,' Mr Potter said. 'For my own child's safety I have to rely on other parents to take a proactive approach.' Mr Potter said he was hesitant to take Ewan back to school the day after he was bullied but didn't want him to fear it altogether. 'I just sat him down and told him what they did was wrong. I still sit there asking if he's okay. He's been really quiet and shut down. 'I don't know how much it's going to affect him. I still can't believe it happened.'","Ewan Potter was attacked by classmates at Brisbane school last month . Boy, five, was left with 'cracking bruises' after being kicked and punched .

"It could be days before Australian Tahnia Cook hears from her husband, Cameron, who was caught up in a devastating cyclone, which has wiped out villages in Vanuatu. At least eight people have been confirmed dead after Cyclone Pam hit the 80-island-strong archipelago, with winds of up to 270km/h and causing heavy flooding, landslides, and mass destruction of buildings. Relief workers are already making their way to Vanuatu, with fears the body count will rise, as Foreign Affairs Minister Julie Bishop announced a $5 million aid package for the ravaged country, the ABC reported. Scroll down for video . Australian Tahnia Cook has not heard from her husband, Cameron, since Friday and holds fears for his safety . People have started clearing up debris and dealing with the damage to their homes in Seaside, near the Vanuatu capital of Port Vila . Vanuatu's president made an emotional appeal for international assistance after his island nation was hit by a calamity of a cyclone . Vanuatu declared a state of emergency on March 15 and a curfew was enforced after reports of 'low -level looting' It has been confirmed at least eight people are dead following Cyclone Pam in Vanuatu . Communications and power for more than 260,000 people is still down, and access to a lot of areas has been cut off. This leaves many Australians concerned for the safety of their family members - including Tahnia Cook who has not heard from her husband, Cameron, since Friday. Ms Cook told Daily Mail Australia they had moved to Vanuatu for 'a change of lifestyle' and help run a local resort in North Efate. She said it had been a terrible few days for her as she awaits news of her husband. 'It's looking to be a couple of days [before I hear from him],' Ms Cook said. 'Nobody has gone to the other side of the island because... [the Department of Foreign Affairs] haven't had a chance to venture out of [Port] Vila to get to surrounding villages.' Ms Cook, who had been travelling between Australia and Vanuatu for a while now, said she also held concerns for locals and resort staff who she considered family now. Ms Cook (left) said it would be days before she would hear from her husband (right) as communications were down . The couple moved to the archipelago last year for 'a change of lifestyle', Ms Cook said . Foreign Affairs Minister Julie Bishop has announced a $5 million aid package for the devastated country . The funds will be distributed through non-government organisations, such as Red Cross Australia . The cyclone is expected to track to the northeast of New Zealand during the next two days . Ms Cook said she had not slept because she was worried about her husband and friends she considered family . The Australian told Weekend Today the last time she had spoken to her husband he had preparing for the storm. She said she was trying to stay positive as Cameron was prepared for the worst at their new home, North Efate. 'It's painful, it's tiring. I haven't slept, I'm hanging on and hope to hear something soon,' Ms Cook said. 'He was well-prepared, he was putting up timber on windows. He was putting heavy items up on tin roofs. He was packing away all objects that could pick up in the strong wind. 'He obviously preparing for his own safety in terms of food, water supply - for himself and the local villagers.' Heavy damage in Vanuatu means some areas are safe to be accessed at the moment . But it is feared the body count will rise with aid workers already heading to the devastated archipelago .

Ms Cook said she would have been there with him if she had not travelled to Brisbane for medical reasons. 'Now I'm worried that's where it's been most impacted on that side of the island and I'm not too sure where he is or what he is doing right now,' she said. 'I'm really trying to stay positive and hope for the best but the reality is the photos and images I've seen from Port Vila so far, knowing that North Efate was in the direct line of the eye of the cyclone and it would have impacted a lot worse than Vila is not great news.' Ms Cook said she was expecting to go back home and see complete devastation as the photos she had seen of buildings and structures damaged by Cyclone Pam were a lot stronger than the ones in North Efate.

'We're helping to run a small family resort, which will be absolutely annihilated,' she told Daily Mail Australia. 'We were starting to get on track and all that's completely washed away now. We had a herb garden, new furniture, a restaurant and bungalows. 'I don't even know if I'll have a house to come back to. We might have to come back to Australia.' Ms Cook also appealed to Australians for aid to help locals with their recovery efforts. 'Keep coming to Vanuatu, [locals are] really going to need money to keep coming through,' she said. 'After the funding stops, it's just a tourism trade. It's going to be really hard for us - we'll pull through but I’m more concerned about the locals.' Ms Cook said she had already started fundraising for North Efate area. With $600 under her belt so far, she was hoping to get to $10,000.

'I have heard our cyclone shutters bash aggressively against the windows. I have heard what sounds like someone’s roof land on ours. I heard rain bash the roof like someone playing the drums.' Ms Morrison later told AAP: 'There are reports from our other colleagues of entire villages being literally blown away overnight.' Following the Category 5 disaster, Foreign Affairs Minister Julie Bishop said the $5 million aid package would be decimated through non-government organisations, Red Cross Australia and the United Nations. 'We will also be deploying humanitarian suppliers to provide support for up to 5,000 people in the form of water, sanitation and shelter,' she told the ABC. 'We will be sending military transport planes, and deployment personnel, medical, humanitarian, consular, natural disaster experts and of course supplies.' Earlier on Saturday, Ms Bishop said there were probably 3,000 Australians in Vanuatu at any one time, but the government had not received any reports regarding Australian citizens. The minister urged those who are concerned about their friends and families in Vanuatu should contact 1300 555 135.

"It may have been the slowest chase ever when a tortoise attempted to run down a television presenter who interrupted it having sex with its mate. Paul Rose - who hosts National Geographic's Pristine Seas - was on Assumption Island, north of Madagascar, when he heard an animal call, which he described as a 'blowing sound'. As he walked towards the strange noise, it soon became apparent Rose and his cameraman had stumbled upon a male and female tortoise mating. Scroll down for video . Television host Paul Rose was chased by a male tortoise after he interrupted it mating with a female tortoise . The pair were more than 180 metres from where the presenter initially heard the noise. As Rose and his cameraman stop and try to observe the ritual, the giant tortoises stop mating. The presenter said he did not know whether or not they had stopped because of their close proximity or they had finished. The animals are seen touching noses as Rose and his cameraman watch from behind bushes. He was on Assumption Island - north of Madagascar - when the incident happened during filming . Rose and his cameraman were there taping for his National Geographic show, Pristine Seas . The host heard a 'blowing sound' while he was walking the island and went towards, discovering the tortoises . Almost immediately the male tortoise spots them and slowly begins to turn himself around, pointing himself in the direction of the television crew. The animal then starts to make its way towards them, with as much gusto as it can muster. Rose is heard telling his cameraman, 'Don't move', as it becomes apparent the tortoise is after them. As the reptile gets closer and closer to the camera, he shows no sign of stopping and so the cameraman jumps back. What ensues is a very low speed chase where the tortoise tries to defend his territory and take a bite out of Rose. The male tortoise slowly turned around to start running after the pair who were startled by the move . Humouring the reptile, Rose continued to slowly back away from it instead of running, observing its behaviour . Rose said it was the male tortoise's way of protecting his territory and getting him away from the female . Later, the host said the tortoise had ended up chasing them for about 365 metres in a circle . 'This is the male saying, ""Hey I think you've interrupted my mating session"",' Rose told the audience as the tortoise inches closer. 'You can't blame him he's in the bushes over there mating on this beautiful, private island and I pitch up to take a look.' Rose continued to humour the tortoise instead of running away. He said it was completely relentless in his pursuit, chasing them around in a 365-metre-loop.","Paul Rose, from National Geographic, was chased down by a giant tortoise .

"Twitter has admitted it needs to get tougher on trolls and has already introduced new ways to report abuse to weed out the perpetrators. But now it's taking aim at the rising levels of revenge porn and stolen nude photos posted to the site. Its rules now say that users must not 'post intimate photos or videos that were taken or distributed without the subject's consent'. Twitter's rules have been updated in an attempt to clamp down on revenge porn. Under 'Private information' (pictured) the guidelines now say that users must not 'post intimate photos or videos that were taken or distributed without the subject's consent'. The site said it will verify complaints and suspended abusive users . The changes were spotted by BuzzFeedNews, which recently submitted a Q&A to Reddit when the community site took a similar stance against pornographic posts. Twitter has used these questions to address the changes. Both Twitter's rules and abusive behaviour policy have been updated to reflect these changes. Twitter said that an affected user can report a post if they believe it contains photos or videos posted without their consent. In February a law was passed that made posting revenge porn images and videos a criminal offence in England and Wales. Both Scotland and Northern Ireland are considering similar laws. Under the rules, revenge porn is considered: 'photographs or films which show people engaged in sexual activity or depicted in a sexual way or with their genitals exposed, where what is shown would not usually be seen in public'. It covers images shared without the subject's permission and 'with the intent to cause harm. Offenders face up to two years in jail. This follows laws in sixteen US states - including Alaska, California,  New Jersey and Texas - explicitly relating to revenge porn. Under copyright laws the video or photos technically belong to the person who took it and who can, in theory, distribute it as they see fit but  Twitter's rules additionally considers the people in the footage. It will ask the person reporting the abuse to verify  they are the person in the post and that it was posted without their permission. Twitter said 'agents will then act on content posted in violation of the policy', including removing the post or suspending the accounts of repeat offenders. 'Users who believe that content they post has been incorrectly identified is violating the policy can appeal the decision and agents will review that request as well,' said the firm. 'Content that is identified as violating our policy will be hidden from public view and users posting it will have their accounts locked; those users will be required to delete the content in question before being able to return to the platform. 'Users posting such content with an intent to harass will be subject to suspension from Twitter.' The changes follow reports Twitter would start banning users who violate its rules by tracking  email addresses and phone numbers. This means that if an offender attempts to sign up for other accounts using these details Twitter will be able to intervene. Reports recently claimed Twitter will start banning trolls and abusive users by tracking email addresses and phone numbers. When people sign up by email they are also given the option to add a phone number (pictured). In the future, Twitter may  ban accounts accused of abuse until they provide this number . Stories of abuse, threats and internet trolls have become commonplace on Twitter in recent years. Robin Williams' daughter, Zelda Williams, left the social platform last year after being sent disturbing images in the wake of her father's suicide. Feminist critic Anita Sarkeesian was threatened with rape, sexual violence and death by Twitter trolls during the 'Gamergate' saga after she criticised the way women are portrayed in video games. In the UK, journalist Caroline Criado-Perez also received rape threats after she voiced her support for the campaign to introduce Jane Austen as the new face of the £10 note. Twitter users Isabella Sorley and John Nimmo admitted sending the messages to Ms Criado-Perez and both were jailed last year. When people sign up to Twitter they are required to provide an email address, which is then validated. Adding a phone number is an optional step and is predominantly used if people want to receive text notifications or setup two-step verification. Under the reported plans, once a user is banned these email addresses and phone numbers will be stored and cross-referenced each time a new user signs up to the site. Last month an internal memo sent by Twitter's chief executive Dick Costolo revealed the 51-year-old thinks his site 'sucks at dealing with abuse and trolls'. In the memo, Mr Costolo said  he is embarrassed by the way the company handles abuse and that it must take stronger action in the future. Mr Costolo's comments were posted on an internal forum among Twitter employees, after one employee raised the question of what more could be done to tackle online abuse. In December, a blog post titled 'Building a safer Twitter' revealed  Twitter is working on ways to make it easier to block and report abuse. The site has since improved the reporting process to make it more mobile-friendly, and it now requires less initial information. In December, a blog post titled 'Building a safer Twitter' revealed  Twitter is working on ways to make it easier to block and report abuse. The site has since improved the reporting process to make it more mobile-friendly, and it now requires less initial information. It has also made it simpler to flag tweets and accounts for review . These enhancements similarly improved the reporting process for people who see abuse but aren't directly receiving it. More recently the site posted a follow-up blog updating users on its new safety features. MailOnline has contacted Twitter for more information about how users details will be stored . Under the Malicious Communications Act 1988, any 'indecent or grossly offensive' message that causes 'distress or anxiety' to the recipient can lead to prosecution. The maximum punishment is a fine not exceeding level four on the standard scale - i.e. no more than £2,500. Since the 1988 law came into force before the widespread use of the internet, e-mail and social networking, prosecutors have used a number of different laws to charge Twitter trolls. Student Liam Stacey, who sent a series of racially abusive tweets after footballer Fabrice Muamba collapsed, was charged under the Crime and Disorder Act. Two men jailed for inciting riots last summer were found guilty under the Serious Crime Act, and Paul Chambers, who joked he would blow Doncaster airport 'sky high' was charged under the Communications Act 2003. It has also made it simpler to flag tweets and accounts for review. These enhancements similarly improved the reporting process for people who see abuse but aren't directly receiving it. More recently, the site posted a follow-up blog updating users on its new safety features. Tina Bhatnagar, Twitter's vice president of User Services said: 'Over the last six months, in addition to the product changes, we have overhauled how we review user reports about abuse. 'Overall, we now review five times as many user reports as we did previously, and we have tripled the size of the support team focused on handling abuse reports. 'We are also beginning to add several new enforcement actions for use against accounts that violate our rules. These new actions will not be visible to the vast majority of rule-abiding Twitter users - but they give us new options for acting against the accounts that don't follow the rules and serve to discourage behavior that goes against our policies. The safety of our users is extremely important to us. It's something we continue to work hard to improve.' In recent years Twitter has come under fire for failing to protect its users from trolls. Robin Williams' daughter, Zelda Williams, left the social platform last year after being sent disturbing images in the wake of her father's death. She made an appeal to her  followers to report two users on Twitter (shown above)","Twitter updated its rules and behaviour policy to tackle revenge porn .

"Sir Michael Wilshaw, chief inspector of schools and children’s services, said saving youngsters from exploitation required ‘political and moral courage' Politicians were yesterday warned they should never ignore sex crimes against children out of a misguided fear of being called racist. Sir Michael Wilshaw, chief inspector of schools and children’s services, said saving youngsters from exploitation required ‘political and moral courage’ on the part of local leaders. ‘They must never allow misguided beliefs about the impact for certain ethnic and cultural groups to get in the way of confronting this horrific abuse wherever it occurs,’ he added. His warning came amid the row over the failure of social workers, politicians or police to act against gangs of mostly Pakistani men who exploited hundreds of children in Rotherham and Oxford. An inquiry last month said Rotherham councillors shied away from the issue for fear of being accused of disturbing ‘community cohesion’. It added: ‘By failing to take action against the Pakistani heritage male perpetrators of child sexual exploitation in the borough, the council has inadvertently fuelled the far-Right.’ Last week an inquiry into a similar scandal in Oxford, carried out by the head of the local safeguarding board, said there was ‘no evidence of any agency not acting when they should have done because of racial sensitivities’. But the Thames Valley Police and Crime Commissioner accused it of ‘pulling its punches’. Sir Michael’s warning was contained in an Ofsted report that found most local councils charged with looking after children’s safety are failing at the job. Only ten out of 43 inspected over the course of a year were found to give a good standard of care and protection. Criticised: Rotherham's director of children's services between 2008 and 2014 Joyce Thacker (left) and former Rotherham Council leader Roger Stone (right) were both criticised for their inaction over the scandal . Sir Michael said youngsters who go missing from children’s homes while in council care are disproportionately at risk of abuse but social workers in some areas still fail to take notice of them. He added: ‘We found children and young people who had been missing were either not having an interview on their return or having one that was of poor quality. 'There was no clear understanding of why children had gone missing.’",Sir Michael Wilshaw said ‘political and moral courage’ is needed in future .

"Four people have been sentenced to death in Tanzania after  brutally murdering a young albino woman in order to harvest her body parts as good luck charms. Zawadi Mangidu, 22, was killed in north-western town of Geita by a group that included her husband, who is among those due to be executed. There is no guarantee the death penalties will ever actually be carried out, however, as the east African nation has had a moratorium on executions for the past 21 years. The conviction comes just days after Tanzania's President Jakaya Kikwete promised to end a wave of killings of albinos, saying the witchcraft-related murders are shaming Tanzania. Innocent victims: More than 40 albinos have been killed in Tanzania since 2007 - but the government insists it is taking action to end the murders . Activists say attackers have killed at least 75 albinos in Tanzania since 2000 to use their body parts in rituals. 'We will not allow things to escalate as they did in previous years,' Kikwete said in a national address on Monday. 'I believe that with close cooperation between the government and society, we will succeed in ending these killings of persons with albinism and rid our nation of this shame.' There are about 200,000 albinos in Tanzania, most of them easily recognisable as they lack pigment in their skin, eyes and hair. Witch doctors often tell clients that albino body parts will bring them luck in love, life and business. Similar beliefs exist in other African societies, but activists say attacks on albinos are particularly prevalent in Tanzania, where one in every 1,400 people is affected, compared with one in 20,000 in the Western world. Activists say attackers have killed at least 75 albinos in Tanzania since 2000 to use their body parts in rituals . At least 50 people died and dozens were hurt in heavy rains and floods in Tanzania's northwest, a senior official said Wednesday. Torrential rains, hail and high winds hit Kahama district in Shinyanga region late on Tuesday, injuring at least 82 people. 'At least 50 people are now confirmed dead,' Shinyanga's regional commissioner, Ally Rufunga said. 'More bodies of victims believed to have been swept by floods were found in the area and others died in hospital while receiving treatment,' he said, updating a previous death toll of 38. A statement from the office of President Jakaya Kikwete expressed his 'shock and extreme grief' at the disaster. Officials said an estimated 3,500 people in the region, a poor farming area south of Lake Victoria and near the Serengeti game reserve, had been affected by the flooding. 'It is a false belief that if someone has the body part of a person with albinism, this will bring success in business, fishing and mining activities. This is what has been fuelling this ongoing evil,' Kikwete said. Tanzanian police on Monday banned a planned demonstration by the Tanzania Albinism Society in the country's commercial capital, Dar es Salaam, citing security reasons. But Kikwete said he had agreed to meet albino leaders next week to discuss possible solutions to the killings. Kikwete said more than 40 albinos have been killed since 2007 but insisted that his government was taking action to end the murders. He did give details on how the government would stop the killings. The murders have been concentrated in gold-rich regions and fishing communities surrounding the country's Lake Victoria area where superstitious beliefs are rampant. Activists say most attacks are not reported to the police.","Zawadi Mangidu, 22, was killed by a gang in north-western town of Geita .

"One has straight ginger hair, a fair complexion and deep blue eyes. The other has masses of curls, far darker skin and her eyes are a sparkling brown. With such opposing looks it’s hard to believe this striking pair are sisters. But they are much more than that – they are twins. The girls were born with radically different colouring thanks to a quirk of their mixed-race parentage. Scroll down for video . Same same, but different:  Lucy and Maria Aylmer, 18, from Gloucester are non-identical twins . Lucy and Maria Aylmer’s mother Donna is half Jamaican and their father Vince is white, and together they managed to produce one white twin and one black twin. The girls were born in January 1997. Their mother was astonished when she first saw the twins, as nothing on the scans had prepared her for their different skin tones. Fair-haired Lucy, who lives with her family in Gloucester, said: ‘It was such a shock for her because things like skin colour don’t show up on scans before birth. 'So she had no idea that we were so different. When the midwife handed us both to her she was just speechless.’ Their mother, who is 47 and a warehouse worker, and their 53-year-old father, who works as a scaffolder, split up after the twins were born. Family line: The twins' mother Donna is half Jamaican and their father Vince is white, and their siblings George, Chynna and Jordan all have darker skin than Lucy and lighter than Maria . Two of a kind: The twins, who live in Gloucester, were born in January 1997 . Different strokes:  'Outgoing' Maria studies law at Cheltenham College, while 'shy' Lucy studies art and design at Gloucester College . All together: Maria and Lucy with their mother Donna and siblings George, 23, Chynna, 22, and Jordan, 21 . The 18-year-olds have three older siblings, George, 23, Chynna, 22, and Jordan, 21. Lucy said: ‘Our brothers and sisters have skin which is inbetween Maria and I. We are at opposite ends of the spectrum and they are all somewhere inbetween. Non-identical twins come from separate eggs, so inherit different genes. The girls’ half-Jamaican mother carries genes for both white and black skin. By chance, Lucy will have inherited genes for white skin and Maria will have genes that code for black skin. People with Afro-Caribbean heritage often have some European DNA, dating back in many cases to the slave trade. This increases the chance of them passing on a gene for white skin to at least one twin. ‘But my grandmother has a very fair English rose complexion, just like mine.’ She added: ‘No one ever believes we are twins. Even when we dress alike, we still don’t look like sisters, let alone twins. Friends have even made us produce our birth certificates to prove it.’ Certainly at school there were no problems mistaking the twins for one another – and no way of playing tricks to confuse their classmates. Lucy said: ‘We were in the same class, but no one had a problem telling us apart. Twins are known for swapping identities. But there was no way Maria and I could ever do anything like that. ‘Most twins look like two peas in a pod – but we couldn’t look more different if we tried. We don’t look like we have the same parents, let alone having been born at the same time.’ The twins’ interests are as different as their looks. Lucy studies art and design at Gloucester College whilst Maria studies law at Cheltenham College. Lucy explained: ‘Maria was outgoing whilst I was the shy one. But Maria loves telling people at college that she has a white twin – and I’m very proud of having a black twin.’","Lucy and Maria Aylmer, 18, from Gloucester are non-identical twins .

"(CNN)Swedish prosecutors have asked Julian Assange's legal representatives whether the WikiLeaks founder would consent to be interviewed in London and have his DNA taken via a swab. Assange has been holed up in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London since June 2012 to avoid extradition to Sweden, where prosecutors want to question him about 2010 allegations that he raped one woman and sexually molested another. Swedish prosecutors have previously balked at coming to Britain to question Assange. However, a number of the crimes Julian Assange is suspected of will be subject to a statute of limitation in August 2015, according to a statement from Marianne Ny, the director of public prosecutions. ""If Assange gives his consent, the prosecutor will promptly submit a request for legal assistance to the British authorities to further continue the investigation,"" the statement said. A request will also be made to the Ecuadorian authorities for permission to ""perform investigative measures"" at its London embassy, the statement said. Ecuador granted Assange political asylum in 2012. Assange's defense lawyer, Per E. Samuelsson, said he called Assange on Friday morning with the news from the prosecution authority -- and that in principle they viewed the request positively. ""I think I woke him up, but he knew I was calling with news about the case since I called so early,"" Samuelsson said. ""He was, of course, very happy that something is finally happening but he is irritated that it has taken such a long time."" This is a step that Assange and his team have been requesting for four years, Samuelsson said. Ny explained the logic behind the Swedish authorities' change of approach in her statement. ""My view has always been that to perform an interview with him at the Ecuadorian embassy in London would lower the quality of the interview, and that he would need to be present in Sweden in any case should there be a trial in the future,"" Ny said. ""This assessment remains unchanged. Now that time is of the essence, I have viewed it therefore necessary to accept such deficiencies to the investigation and likewise take the risk that the interview does not move the case forward, particularly as there are no other measures on offer without Assange being present in Sweden."" The Australian national has not been charged and denies the claims. He's said he fears Sweden would extradite him to the United States, where he could face the death penalty if he is charged and convicted of publishing government secrets through WikiLeaks. Samuelsson said Assange's legal team would travel over to London as soon as possible to discuss Ny's request and that it expects to respond next week. ""The problem is that there are two more countries involved in this request so it might take some time to make all this happen,"" Samuelsson said. Samuelsson also said Friday's development was not a great surprise since Sweden's Supreme Court had last week asked the prosecutor general for an opinion on the case. ""We think that the prosecutor general, who has taken over the case, probably told Prosecutor Ny to interview Assange in London,"" he said. Assange has previously said the arrest warrant should be thrown out because, in part, Swedish authorities declined to interview him at the Ecuadorian Embassy, thereby prolonging a preliminary investigation that he said should have concluded long ago. London's Metropolitan Police said last month that the cost of the operation to guard the embassy to prevent Assange fleeing had spiraled to more than 10 million pounds ($15.3 million.) overall . CNN's Claudia Rebaza contributed to this report .",Lawyer for Assange says they view the request positively but will have to discuss response .

"When Lara Kelly started posting pictures on social media to track her weight loss journey, the 21-year-old never thought she would end up as the face of weight loss scams. The corporate receptionist, from Bunbury in Western Australia, had lost 57 kilograms over three years through exercise and carefully planned eating plans. To keep her motivated, Ms Kelly posted photos on her Tumblr and Instagram pages to help others. Scroll down for video . Lara Kelly's pictures started appearing in weight loss advertisements, promoting diet supplements . The ads claims to help people to lose weight by erasing '13 kilos of belly fat in four weeks' 'It's a hard thing, it's a huge task [to lose weight],' she told Daily Mail Australia. 'I know for me to see other people who have done this and to achieve these results, it’s very motivating for me. I wanted to share my own experiences. 'For other people, it's good to have someone who's been though it before and ask questions.' So far, her Tumblr blog has attracted about 20,000 followers. Another ad found by Lara Kelly, from Bunbury in Western Australia, which used her photo without permission . The 21-year-old has spent three years, exercising and devising eating plans, to lose a total of 57 kilograms . But her well-documented progress was twisted by online advertisements, who started using photographs of her dramatic transformation without her permission, to promote dieting pills which promised to 'erase 13 kilos of belly fat in four weeks'. It was claimed Ms Kelly had used dieting pills to achieve her new look. She had not been aware of the unauthorised use of her image until friends started tagging her and strangers made contact with her about the drugs she had allegedly used for her weight loss. 'People... asked me what my opinion was of them [the pills]. I had to tell them I'd never used them in my life,' Ms Kelly told Daily Mail Australia. 'When it first started getting messages I was shocked. I was trying to get my friends to report [the ads]. But when you get one taken down, 10 more pop up to take its place.' Ms Kelly started out as 120 kilograms and was a size 18 to 20. She is now a size 8 and weighs 63 kilograms . The photographs used were taken from her Tumblr and Instagram sites, which she used to document her progress to motivate others and herself . Ms Kelly said she had tried to track the people who were taking her photo down but she was unsuccessful. 'It's mainly Facebook pages that post the links to other external sites,' she said. 'I message the pages and report them and they just disappear and then pop up again later, or they just block me.' To help combat her picture being used for scams, Ms Kelly started watermarking her snaps with her Instagram handle. But this did not stop them as it could be cropped out or blurred. Ms Kelly urged people not the believe everything they read on the internet. 'Don't look at the picture and assume someone has taken drugs to lose 20 kilos in two weeks,' she said. 'Everyone wants a quick fix. Weight loss is hard, but it's worth it in the end.' Weight loss scams are described by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission's Scam Watch as those that 'promise weight loss for little or no effort'. 'The scam may involve an unusual or restrictive diet, ""revolutionary"" exercise or fat-busting devices, or products such as pills, patches, or creams,' the website said. 'Often, attractive people or celebrities are used to sell the products. These may be people with a different body shape and metabolism to you and who use the product in conjunction with an exercise regime and strict diet. 'At best fad diets and products might result in a temporary weight loss in the short term and can be dangerous if followed over a longer period.'","Lara Kelly found out her photos were being used to promote dieting scams .

"A Los Angeles-based artist claims Versace has ripped off one of her designs. Kesshia 'KESH' Kumari, who has more than 80,000 Instagram followers, used the social networking site to express her views about the luxury fashion house. She uploaded a picture of one of the T-shirts she created with American Apparel inspired by her artwork in 2013 next to Versace's offering, which she captioned: 'At least make it better than the $30 (£20) original @versace_official. This looks like a first draft.' She also uploaded a snap of Versace's £440 Medusa cotton jersey T-shirt and wrote: 'This.hurts. $650.versace rip off. sold out in 3 sizes. what is this madness? from huge designer labels to small boutiques to giant pop stars to fame hungry former friends. what is this? 'Why can't these companies. these brands. these people create their own work? what happened? why do these people think that everything that they lay their eyes on instantly belongs to them? (sic)'. MailOnline has contacted Kesshia Kumari for comment. In an interview with The Cut, the London-born designer said: 'I have always had a deep admiration for Versace. It’s an iconic brand that has stood the test of time. I am deeply disappointed in this. 'This is not only artwork from a show that took me two years to develop and create. It is not only artwork from a collection that I created for American Apparel to provide something affordable and accessible to supporters of my work. ' But this is also my face! I can’t understand how something like this could happen.' Kesshia Kumari, who is of Malaysian and Trinidadian heritage, began designing her graphic creations 17 years ago and began selling them on MySpace. The Versace T-shirt's description on Selfridges website reads: 'Versace’s flair for contemporary prints can be seen with this statement t-shirt. Crafted from cotton-jersey and featuring Medusa’s head printed on the front, simply team with jeans for a luxe off-duty look.' MailOnline has contacted Versace for comment. Speaking to MailOnline, Jim Dennis, an intellectual property partner at law firm Gordon Dadds, the English member firm at Globalaw, said: 'Kesh’s design is certainly distinctive and the Versace design is strikingly similar. Provided Kesh’s design is original, then under UK law it will attract copyright as a graphic work. 'It is for the Court to decide whether Versace has copied Kesh’s design but the similarities between the designs are so substantial the Court may readily infer that copying has taken place. If so, Versace would infringe Kesh’s copyright unless they can prove with clear evidence that they created their design independently and without reference to Kesh’s. If they are found to infringe then they may be liable for damages to Kesh or have to hand over their profits from sales of the offending t-shirts.' Carissa Kendall-Palmer, associate solicitor, EIP in London, added: 'In short, Kesh should be filing a law suit right away. The Versace T-shirt is clearly very similar to the T-shirt she developed for the American Apparel range in 2013. On the face of it, Kesh has a good case, but will need to gather evidence to support it. 'The design could be protected by both design rights and copyright, and it certainly looks like a bit of a rip-off. Many fashion brands rely heavily on these unregistered rights and at times, it can be complicated and expensive to prove their case. She is not on her own here. Copying is very common in the industry. 'There is always the possibility that Versace has a good excuse but it will take some explaining. Copyright infringement is criminal, and if Kesh registered her design, copying that is also a criminal offence under the new 2014 laws. If Kesh has a registered design, she will find it easier to assert her legal rights now.'","Kesshia 'KESH' Kumari, a London-born is a Los Angeles-based artist .

"A Good Samaritan who shoveled his neighborhood's sidewalks was left stunned after an irate neighbor dumped the snow back on the walkway before grabbing him and telling him to keep away. Will Immke, 23, had cleared the snow from a disabled neighbor's driveway and sidewalk in Eastlake, Ohio on Sunday so that she could move around safely. But the good deed didn't impress 69-year-old Larry Myers, who lives next door to the woman. He grabbed his snowblower and started blowing snow back towards Immke as he cleared it up. When Immke told the man he was clearing the sidewalk for the neighbor and so that children could reach their school buses, Myers told him the kids could walk in the street, WKYC reported. Scroll down for video . Spat: Larry Myers, left, can be seen blowing snow onto a sidewalk as Will Immke, right, clears it for a disabled neighbor in Eastlake, Ohio on Sunday. Myers later grabbed Immke and now faces an assault charge . 'And I said ""Are you stupid?""' Immke told the channel. 'And that's when he grabbed me by my throat and my face and shoved me back.' Myers didn't deny grabbing the man but said he only held on to the front of his shirt. 'I grabbed him... and I said ""Leave my sidewalk alone"",' he said. 'I specifically told him I don't need you to shovel my section of the sidewalk,' he added to WOIO. After Immke went back into his home across the street, Myers covered the sidewalk with the snow that had just been removed. It means that Myers has been left with a massive frozen wall of snow on his section of the sidewalk. 'When everybody else around here cleans their sidewalks, I will clean mine,' he said defiantly. Myers complained to Eastlake Police, but they say they are now investigating him for a misdemeanor charge of assault. Immke, pictured, said he told Myers he was clearing the sidewalk for children, and Myers said they could walk in the road instead. When Immke asked him if he was stupid, Myers grabbed him as pictured right . No denial: Myers, pictured, admitted that he had grabbed Immke and told him to stay away from his sidewalk . 'Not very neighborly,' they wrote on their Facebook page as they announced the pending charge. They also shared a photograph taken by a neighbor across the street showing Immke clearing the snow while Myers' snowblower forced snow back on to the path. 'As the complainant continued the snow removal, the suspect returned with a snow blower intentionally blowing snow on the victim shouting for him to leave the area,' the police wrote. The neighbors told WOIO that it's not their first run in. 'This was over snow,' Immke said. 'In the fall it's over the leaves.

"A 22-year-old college student whose disappearance had police scouring Southern California for weeks said she was overwhelmed with personal problems when she decided to walk away. Sahray Barber, whose March 9 disappearance triggered a huge land and air search across Southern California's Inland Empire, resurfaced on March 19. She had spent the ten days living in two Los Angeles-area hospitals under assumed names. Scroll down for video . Sahray Barber vanished on March 9 from her home in San Bernadino, California, and a search effort began . The 22-year-old college student reappeared on March 19 after spending about ten days in LA hospitals . After leaving the second hospital, she met a woman who treated her kindly and finally got her to open up and to reach out to her father, Barber said. Barber called her father from a shelter after seeing news reports about her case and asked to come home. While she was gone, a huge search involving aircraft, dogs and horseback riders was being carried out by police. Barber released a statement to the Riverside Press-Enterprise Enterprise on Thursday trying to explain what happened to her. She said she had lost her job, her car had been wrecked and computer problems were causing her to fall behind in her studies at the Art Institute of California-Inland Empire. She wrote: 'Things got so bad that I didn't know what to say or who to ask for help, . 'I had dug a hole so deep, that I felt entirely hopeless.' She called her father from a shelter after seeing news reports about her case and asked to come home . Barber indicated that she paid little attention to media reports of the search while she was in the hospital, but was stunned when she found out all it involved. The young woman called what she did 'incredibly dumb'. She wrote: 'I ask for everyone's forgiveness, most especially my wonderful family for all the worry and long nights I caused you, and all the amazing men, women, dogs and horses that searched for me.' On the day she vanished, Barber walked out of her apartment, threw her computer and a few other belongings over a wall and left with just a few dollars in her pocket. Her disappearance was even more concerning because two women had recently been assaulted on the campus of California State University, San Bernardino, near Barber's home. San Bernardino Police Chief Jarrod Burguan said the department will seek criminal charges against Barber's roommates. They gave statements to police that indicated Barber had been killed, according to Burguan. It's possible that Barber will face charges as well due to the scope and cost of the investigation.","Sahray Barber vanished on March 9 from San Bernadino, California .

"There's nothing more embarrassing than waking up at someone else's place and having to step out in yesterday's outfit. But now there's a perfect solution to those morning after woes - a top that can be worn 24 different ways in a variety of colours, without the use of any zips, ties or buttons. The Morf shirt is the brainchild of Israeli-based designer Tamara Salem, who came up with the idea as a way of bringing a playful element to her wardrobe and getting more use out of key pieces. Scroll down for video . The future of fashion? The Morf top, which was invented by Israeli-based designer Tamara Salem, can be worn 24 different ways thanks to a clever double-layered construction . Tamara told MailOnline that her invention was 'almost accidental'. 'I was making a shirt as a gift for my best friend's birthday, and I had this vague idea for a multi-layer top with a black front and white back,' she said. 'But only when I actually held it in my hands, I discovered I could flip it and get a totally black shirt, and then flip it again and get an all-white shirt. I realised then how many different options this structure offered,' she explained. A mesmerizing video on the project's Kickstarter page, which has raised a whopping $35,600 so far, shows just how the shirt works with the clever use of double-layer construction. No more outfit repeats: The shirt, which comes in red, blue or green and costs $80 (about £52), is billed as the perfect solution to a morning after situation . The model in the video begins by wearing the top in plain black with a deep V-neck with grey panels on the sleeves. Then she pulls it off inside-out and puts it back on, and this time it has black and white stripes in the front and plain black sleeves. When she rolls up the sleeves, they miraculously become a bright shade of blue. Later, she turns the top inside-out yet again and it becomes grey with a neckline in black and monochrome stripes on the back. All in all, the top can be worn up to 24 different ways, providing almost an entire month of styles using just one piece of clothing. 'I believe that fashion is all about change, inviting us to re-invent ourselves,' said Tamara. 'I hope to get the attention of women who enjoy being unexpected and ever-changing.' Versatile: 'I believe that fashion is all about change, inviting us to re-invent ourselves,' said Tamara .

"(CNN)Hillary Clinton held a closed door meeting with President Barack Obama at the White House on Monday.  Although the former secretary of state, senator and first lady has not declared, it is treated as a foregone conclusion that Clinton is running for president. Likely to launch her campaign in April, Clinton is regarded as the front-runner — if not the only Democratic candidate — and the inevitable Democratic nominee. There is an assumption that since Clinton supported Obama, the black community will now embrace her.  But there are more than a few who didn't get that memo.  At this stage of the game, many African-Americans may not be excited about a candidate Hillary Clinton in 2016. And after two terms of the nation's first black president, she should proceed with caution. Clinton need look no further than the 2008 contest, when black voters doused water on her presidential prospects.  Early on, Clinton was the favorite of black folks, lest you forgot, and it did not hurt that President Clinton had been regarded as the ""first black president"" with high approval among African-Americans. Then, support for a senator named Barack Obama blew up after the Iowa caucuses. And Clinton found herself apologizing for her husband's comments about Obama's win in the South Carolina primary. President Clinton was relieved of his black card privileges for the remainder of the 2008 election season when he compared Obama's win in the Palmetto state to that of Jesse Jackson in 2004 and 2008, suggesting that Obama, like Jackson, would not win.  The misstep was an affront to many African-Americans, as were Hillary Clinton's suggestions on the campaign trail that Obama was only good for making speeches, but not for taking action. And let's not forget her assertions that she was the candidate for ""hard-working Americans, white Americans."" We can chalk up some of that rhetoric to spirited campaign-trail junk-talking, and obviously much has happened since the 2008 election.  President Obama made Clinton his secretary of state, and she served as a capable top diplomat and a loyal member of the Obama Cabinet.  But that does not mean black voters will completely forget the bitter, racially tinged presidential campaign politics of seven years ago. Black voters are among the most loyal of the Democratic Party base, and their record high turnout for Obama  was an important part of his victory.  However, with a charismatic Obama no longer on the ballot, maintaining the same level of enthusiasm for any other candidate is a challenge. theGrio.com: Blacks are treated 72% as well as whites . Moreover, as for Clinton, who (understandably?) has her own ideas and may not agree with the President on certain issues, any criticism of Obama could cost her some black voters.  Remember that Clinton voted in favor of the unpopular, costly and deadly Iraq war.  That support cost Clinton in 2008.  And while she has remained silent on the recent re-election of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Clinton's strongly pro-Israel stance on Mideast peace now appears at odds with the emerging consensus among major groups in the Democratic base, including blacks, Latinos and young voters. However, it is likely that foreign policy will not pose as great a challenge to Hillary Clinton as economics.  Because she is tied to the Wall Street wing of her party and commands sky-high speaking fees, people may take a closer look at her approach to tackling inequality and the shrinking of the middle class, and whether she is too concerned about offending the wealthy. The nation is hurting, despite the economic turnaround, and this is felt particularly strongly among blacks, who still have high unemployment rates, a rising wealth gap compared to whites, and, for many, no recovery in sight. And while police shootings of young black men continue to stir outrage in the community, Clinton has remained relatively quiet on the subject. She will have to prove that she can identify with this frustration and offer ideas for reform in local law enforcement. This, rather than her email account, is what concerns the black electorate. theGrio.com: Let's stop the 'struggle equation' Perhaps a populist, more down-to-earth challenger such as Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren or former Virginia Sen. Jim Webb could appeal to black and working-class voters, and unlike Clinton, would not have to fight the perception of living in a protective security bubble, or lacking core beliefs other than being in power. It is safe to assume that if Clinton wins the Democratic nomination that she will ultimately win the majority black vote in the general election, but that may not be enough. Let's remember President George W. Bush won re-election in 2004 with just 11% of the black vote. Had Mitt Romney been able to duplicate that number of black votes, he would be president now. Obama won in no small part because blacks turned out for him in record numbers in 2012, particularly in swing states like Ohio. Clinton can't assume she'll inherit that same level of black voter enthusiasm.  Support for Barack Obama does not necessarily translate into support for another Democrat.  This means Clinton must fight for votes like anyone else: knock on doors, kiss babies, clap off beat at the AME church, and do whatever it takes.","David Love: The former secretary of state would need to woo African-American voters to turn out in big numbers for 2016 .

"An Australian wildlife warrior has gone where most people would not dare by filming himself swimming alongside deadly saltwater crocodiles. Beau Greaves has tried to show off the 'sensitive side' of the predators and released extraordinary footage of him up close and personal with the reptile on his YouTube channel. The 24-year-old crayfish diver took a dip in the Great Barrier Reef, in Queensland's far north, to capture hours of video, exploring the wildlife it had to offer - including stingrays and wobbegongs, commonly known as the carpet shark. Scroll down for video . Beau Greaves has always had a fascination with wildlife and in a new video he swims dangerously close to saltwater crocodiles . Mr Greaves spends nine months of the year on a trawler working as a crayfish diver near Cape York . On his YouTube page, Mr Greaves said he was a thrill seeker who never did things in halves. His sister, Ebony, told Daily Mail Australia this had always been the case. 'Beau is a very extreme person, as a little kid we grew up at Lake Cooroibah [north of Queensland's Sunshine Coast],' she said. 'Ever since I could remember he would go out for hours by himself, and trawl up and down the lake and catch all kinds of snakes, spiders and eels and other exotic wildlife. 'One time he came home with a crab attached to his finger when he was five years old.' Ms Greaves said her brother had an unexplained connection with wildlife, which helped him swim unnoticed by animals. When asked if she and her family even feared for Mr Greaves' safety, his sister answered: 'Absolutely.' The 24-year-old is seen swimming alongside crocodiles in the Great Barrier Reef in Queensland's far north . At no point in the video does the crocodile appear to behave aggressively towards the Sunshine Coast man . He said he had 'absolutely no fear' but he respected crocodiles and does not touch them with hands . 'To be honest, he's an extreme person. When he's not catching wildlife, he's into surfing and into extreme motocross riding,' she said. 'He always finds the extreme in everything he does. 'No matter how worried our family is... he loves what he is doing. 'I can't ever imagine him being an office person, he loves the wildlife.' Mr Greaves told The Sunday Mail it was 'unbelievable' to be able to swim so closely with the crocodiles, an act which wildlife experts warned was detrimental to his safety. 'They're just a big old dinosaur, and they've got big teeth too,' the wildlife warrior said. This is a carpet shark, also known as a wobbegong, which Mr Greaves also dares to interact with . Here he is seen swimming with his head resting underneath the carpet shark, which looks to be unfazed with this . Mr Greaves also dares to give the shark a pat as he continues to explore the Great Barrier Reef . Mr Greaves is also a reptile carer on the Sunshine Coast and works for nine months of the year diving the coral reefs in remote Cape York for crayfish on a trawler. He uses his time living in the area to film his wildlife videos and gives him an opportunity to learn about dugongs, snakes, turtles, dolphins and whales. Mr Greaves believes he had a 'primal connection' with the dangerous beasts, which he helps them remain calm around him. 'I just gauge their mood, and if they're relaxed, it's all cool. I jump in and swim around with them,' he said. 'I love crocs. I've got absolutely no fear. But I do respect them. And I've learnt my lesson not to touch them.' At one point in the video, the 24-year-old is seen swimming near a stingray with its tail facing the diver. In a terrifying moment, he reaches out and prods the back of the animal with a rod close to its barb. A barb through the chest was what killed Mr Greaves' idol, Steve Irwin, who was known as 'The Crocodile Hunter'. The 24-year-old also dares to swim close to stingrays - which killed crocodile hunter Steve Irwin . He daringly reaches out and prods the stingray's tail with a rod in a terrifying moment . But Professor Grahame Webb, from wildlife sanctuary Crocodylus Park, said Mr Greaves was reducing his life expectancy by swimming so closely with crocodiles. 'Unless he is Doctor Dolittle and can talk to the animals, he's a croc snack waiting to happen,' Prof Webb told News Corp. 'Wow. He's got big kahunas. But that's really asking for it.' For those who think crocodiles that live in open water or reefs are not as deadly, Prof Webb said this was simply not the case. According to News Corp, 10 per cent of the 111 attacks that have happened since crocodile hunting was banned in Australia in the 1970s involved scuba divers, snorkellers or spear fishermen - putting Mr Greaves in the 'very high-risk category'.",Beau Greaves is seen swimming alongside saltwater crocodiles in a video .

"The heartbroken parents of a beautiful four-week-old baby boy who died due to complications arising from whooping cough have been forced to defend themselves from online trolls. After urging other parents to get themselves and their children immunised against the deadly disease, Greg and Catherine Hughes have been inundated by messages from strangers - but not all of them have been kind. ‘To all the strangers sending me Facebook messages and asking why my son wasn't vaccinated. He was 4 weeks old!!! Too young to be vaccinated!,’ mother Catherine wrote on Facebook. ‘Go learn something about immunisation and stop bothering me. Our whole family was vaccinated but we live in the state with the worst vaccine rates and sometimes family vaccination just isn't enough to protect our babies,’ she added. Riley Hughes died at just 32 days old after suffering complications arising from whooping cough . Riley's parents Greg and Catherine Hughes have been inundated by messages from strangers . In the comments section of a Daily Telegraph article online a man named Rich also asked ‘if the mother of baby Riley was immunised and breast feeding?' 'This is one of the simplest ways to protect a child too young to be vaccinated,' he said. ‘Thank you for questioning me. I was fortunate to breastfeed my daughter for two years and my son Riley for the four weeks of his little life until he had to use a feeding tube in hospital, where I then expressed milk,’ Catherine responded. ‘I was also vaccinated as a child and received the booster shot three years before his birth, and was told my medical professionals this was sufficient. - Riley’s Mum.’ The couple, from Perth, who set up a Facebook page to honour their son Riley Hughes after he ‘passed away peacefully in the arms of his mummy and daddy’ at 2pm on March 17, aged just 32 days, publicly spoke about their son’s death in the hope it would help prevent more children dying from the preventable disease. Riley’s father Greg posted a touching tribute on Facebook to his ‘darling little angel Riley’ Two days before Riley died his mother posted a photo of him wrapped in a blanket in hospital . ‘Our greatest desire out of our own personal tragedy is to stop parents from having to endure the heartache of preventable childhood deaths,’ Riley’s dad Greg wrote on the Facebook page Light for Riley. Catherine Hughes has stood up to people who questioned her online . The newborn, born on February 13, died in Perth's Princess Margaret Hospital as a result of pneumonia-based complications arising from whooping cough. The brave family have now raised an incredible $36,000 for the Princess Margaret Hospital Foundation after setting up a fundraising page in honour of baby Riley. Greg Hughes wrote: ‘It was with a mixture of tears and joy that I logged on early this morning to see that we'd surpassed our initial goal of $32,000! The last few days have been unbelievably difficult for my family, but this incredible show of humanity has kept us occupied and given us a drive to change the world.’ Updating the more than 50,000 who now follow the Light for Riley Facebook page, Greg said ‘We're hearing that across Australia many Medical Practitioners, Pharmacies and Suppliers are completely out of the vaccine. ‘We've seen change in WA and NSW with whispers that other states are hopefully set to follow suit. None of this could have been achieved without the phenomenal response from the people on this page. The support has been worldwide and humbling to say the least. ‘Thank you so much for your continued support, please continue driving the message and donating to this worthwhile cause. We're just getting started.’ Two days before his death, his mother Catherine posted a devastating photo of her son wrapped up in a blanket in his hospital bed urging people to get themselves and their children immunised against whooping cough. The heartbroken parents of baby Riley have been forced to defend themselves from online trolls . Riley's father Greg appeared on Sunrise on Monday morning to thank the community for their fundraising and support . ‘If you haven't been immunised against whooping cough (pertussis) please consider getting it done.

'If you're anti-immunisation/anti-logic/anti-duty of care to your society as a whole, then feel free to take a look at this picture of my son in hospital right now at 4 weeks old with whooping cough - and then come and tell me how you think immunisation is a bad thing,' Greg added. On March 17 Catherine then posted the tragic news that Riley had died. ‘We are devastated to let everyone know our gorgeous sweet month-old son Riley John Hughes lost his battle with whooping cough at Princess Margaret Hospital earlier today,’ she wrote. ‘He passed away peacefully in our arms after a tough fight. The staff at PMH were amazing and did everything they could to save his little life but the whooping cough was too severe. RIP Riley. Forever in our hearts.’ His mother Catherine Hughes posted a brave tribute to her baby boy and thanked Perth's Princess Margaret Hospital for doing 'everything they could to save his little life' 'Heartbreaking to watch 4 week old Riley struggle,' Catherine Hughes wrote as she urged people to get themselves immunised . Riley’s father Greg also posted a touching tribute on Facebook to his ‘darling little angel Riley’. Greg wrote that Riley was ‘cruelly cut down before his life had an opportunity to start’. ‘I'm an absolute shell of a man without my baby boy and I'm truly not sure how I'll cope,’ he said as he honoured ‘the short but enormous legacy this little man has left behind’. The Facebook page Greg and Catherine have set up already has over 25,000 likes. Greg wrote that the family’s long-term goal is to ‘be the drivers of change within this country surrounding the treatment, management and long term eradication of this horrific disease. We invite you to share this page with anyone and everyone.’ Catherine told Mamamia that her whole family is immunised and that they had also asked their friends and families to have boosters. The Department of Health says it does not know how the child contracted the respiratory disease, also known as pertussis. Whooping cough is part of the routine vaccination schedule for babies at two months, four months and six months of age. Booster doses are given at 4 years and 10-15 years. Infectious Diseases Expert at ANU Medical School Canberra, Sanjaya Senanayake, told Daily Mail Australia: 'From my point of view immunisation is wonderful particularly for whooping cough.' Whooping cough (also known as ‘pertussis’) is a highly contagious bacterial infection of the lungs and airways. The government health website says the disease is 'highly infectious and most serious in babies under the age of 12 months'. Babies are at greatest risk of infection until they can have at least two doses of the vaccine (minimum 4 months old) as the mother’s antibodies do not provide reliable protection. It’s very rare for children who have been immunised against whooping cough to get the disease – and if they do, it’s usually not as serious. Symptoms . The condition usually begins with a persistent dry and irritating cough that progresses to intense bouts of coughing. These are followed by a distinctive ‘whooping’ noise, which is how the condition gets its name. The early symptoms of whooping cough are often similar to those of a common cold and may include: . These early symptoms of whooping cough can last for one to two weeks, before becoming more severe. The second stage of whooping cough is often called the paroxysmal stage and is characterised by intense bouts of coughing. Each bout of coughing usually lasts between one and two minutes. Infants younger than six months may not make the ‘whoop’ sound after coughing, but they may start gagging or gasping, and may temporarily stop breathing. Information supplied by HealthDirect.gov.au . The devastated parents have set up a Facebook page that already has over 25,000 likes . He explained infants are 'at a high risk of dying if they get infected' and that the death rate from whooping cough in infants under 6 months of age is about 1 per cent. 'It's important to listen to the experts,' Mr Senanayake said. 'Whooping cough is lethal in babies and in adults people can be absent from work for the persistent cough, it's a nasty infection.' According to the department's notifiable disease report, there have been 244 cases of whooping cough in WA in the year to date, compared to 292 cases for the corresponding period last year and 232 cases in the first 10 weeks of 2013. Data recorded on immunisation rates across Australia on the Department of Health's website shows, in 2012, WA had the lowest vaccination rates for whooping cough and for immunisation overall. In WA 91 per cent of children were immunised against diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis by 12 months of age and 90.2 per cent were fully immunised. In 2013, the Department of Health report said that despite a long-standing immunisation program, 'pertussis remains highly prevalent in Australia and the least well controlled of all vaccine-preventable diseases'. 'Epidemics occur every 3 to 4 years. In unvaccinated populations, these outbreaks can be very large. In vaccinated populations, outbreaks are smaller, with greatly reduced mortality and morbidity, and may continue to occur every 3 to 4 years or be more widely spaced,' the report said.","Riley Hughes died in a Perth hospital at just 32 days old on March 17 .

Kamal put himself at the centre of a row over umpiring decisions which went the way of India in their World Cup quarter-final victory over Bangladesh in Melbourne on Thursday. India opener Rohit Sharma was reprieved as he neared his century when a no-ball was called because of the height of the delivery; then Bangladesh batsman Mahmudullah had to go when a marginal call came down in favour of boundary fielder Shikhar Dhawan, whose foot was ruled to be just clear of the rope when he took a catch at fine-leg. Shikhar Dhawan's catch of Bangladesh's batsman Mahmudullah during their quarter final proved controversial . Bangladeshi politician Kamal's ICC role is largely ceremonial since cricket's world governing body updated its constitution a year ago. He has nonetheless threatened to resign over the decisions taken by umpires Aleem Dar and Ian Gould in the match which finished in a 109-run win for India. Kamal implied the result was a foregone conclusion, and that world cricket is being run for the benefit of its superpower India. 'There was no quality in the umpiring. It looked like they took the field after it [the outcome] was pre-arranged,' he said. 'As the ICC president, whatever I have to say I will say it in next meeting. It could happen that maybe I will resign. There was doubt about whether the fielder had made contact with the boundary rope, but the decision stood . 'I cannot represent the ""Indian Cricket Council"". If someone has imposed a result on us, in that case no one can accept it.' ICC chief executive David Richardson has responded with an emphatic dismissal of Kamal's insinuations. He said: 'The ICC has noted Mr Mustafa Kamal's comments, which are very unfortunate but made in his personal capacity. Rohit Sharma was given a reprieve after being caught out off a no ball, and went on to make three figures . 'As an ICC president, he should have been more considerate in his criticism of ICC match officials, whose integrity cannot be questioned. 'The no-ball decision was a 50-50 call. The spirit of the game dictates that the umpire's decision is final and must be respected. 'Any suggestion that the match officials had 'an agenda' or did anything other than perform to the best of their ability are baseless and are refuted in the strongest possible terms.'

"It is one of the world's best loved musicals - the true story of a novice nun who falls in love with a widower and his seven children. From Julie Andrews waltzing through the Alps to seven children behaving perfectly,  The Sound of Music might look like it portrays the family everyone wants. But Andrews' real life counterpart - Maria Kutschera - was far from the idealized mother the popular film portrays. In fact she was a difficult Austrian woman plagued by insecurities. Scroll down for video . Maria Kutschera (centre) was far from the idealized mother The Sound of Music portrays, her son has revealed in a new book . Whereas Julie Andrews (above) waltzed carelessly through the Alps in the 1965 film, Maria was described by her son Johannes as 'incredibly strong' with 'literally an indomitable will' Her son Johannes has now revealed all in a new book written by Tom Santopietro. He said: 'She was  incredibly strong with a formidable will, literally an indomitable will. 'And sometimes running into that will was not so pleasant.' The 75-year-old added that his mother was very complex and admitted that she was unhappy as a child. Maria was born in 1905 while travelling from her parents' village in Tyrol to a hospital in Vienna, Austria, on a train. By the time she was ten both of her parents had died and she was sent to live with a violent uncle. Maria escaped from him and in 1926 she was a schoolteacher at the Nonnberg Abbey, in Salzburg, intending to become a nun. But while there she was asked to take a job as a governess at the home of a widowed man, who was left with seven children after his first wife Agatha died of scarlet fever. That man was Georg von Trapp. They would quickly become married and have three more children. Georg von Trapp was previously the commander of Austrian submarine U5. He is pictured with his fiancée Agathe Whitehead . The Von Trapp family are pictured in 1939. Top row: Werner and Rupert; Second row: Dr. Franz Wasner, Johanna, Martina, Maria and Georg, Johannes, Hedwig, Maria; Bottom: Agathe, Rosmarie and Eleonore . The family, including Andrews (centre), perform a song in the film. Rosmarie, one of Maria and Georg's children who does not feature in the film, said: 'We never went running in a field and singing songs like that' It was not long before Maria founded a family choir. Although the children sang together before she joined them, they remember her particularly pushing  public performances - especially after Georg lost his fortune. Rosmarie, one of Maria and Georg's children, often found her mother particularly difficult. She said it got worse after her father died in 1947. 'I was not happy on stage. I was made to do it,' Boudicca Fox-Leonard of the Sunday People reported her saying. The now 87-year-old said: 'We never went running in a field and singing songs like that. We had a hard life. It was a struggle.' In real life, after fleeing the country in 1938 the von Trapp's came to rely on their musical performances for money . She also recounts Maria sending her for shock therapy after she had a breakdown and said she locked step-daughter Johanna in a room for announcing she was getting married. After fleeing the country  in 1938, the family - known as the Trapp Family Singers in the US - came to rely on the performances for money. The popular film was made after Broadway found a book  detailing the family's adventurers. Maria later sold the rights  to Hollywood for £3,000. But director Robert Wise rebuffed her attempts to act as an adviser. He admitted in an interview: 'She was bossy, I didn't like that about her.' Even director Robert Wise rebuffed Maria's attempts to act as an adviser. He admitted in an interview: 'She was bossy, I didn't like that about her' Only three children, none of which feature in the film, survive. The last surviving von Trapp singer died in early 2014. Four of the couple's great-grandchildren are still attempting to keep the tradition alive. Sofi, Melanie, Amanda, and their younger brother August have revived the family's musical heritage and are singing together. They can remember little of their great-grandmother. Sofi said: 'We know she was a little impulsive, but without her the family would never have survived as a single group. 'The Captain would have been taken off to war if it wasn't for the singing.'

"The Russian embassy says it hopes a koala hugged by President Vladimir Putin at the G20 summit in Brisbane has survived a mass culling of the marsupials by wildlife officers. The seemingly light-hearted comment on the embassy's Facebook page refers to the summit in Queensland, but the koala cull was carried out in Victoria. The message follows news that 686 koalas were put down near Victoria's Great Ocean Road in 2013 and 2014, an operation carried out in secret to avoid a backlash from activists and locals. Wildlife officers captured and euthanised the koalas, reportedly by lethal injection, in response to overpopulation and starvation in the area's manna gum woodlands. Scroll down for video . Prime Minister Tony Abbott (left) and Russia's President Vladimir Putin met koalas before the start of the first G20 meeting in Brisbane in November . The Russian Embassy in Australia posted this status on Facebook yesterday showing their concern after news of the koala cull that happened in 2013 and 2014 . The Russian embassy's message reads: 'Hope in the number of euthanised koalas did not get those animals that leaders at the G20 Summit in Brisbane were photographed with.' The post includes photographs of President Putin and US President Barack Obama holding koalas at the G20 summit in November. The summit was notable for Western leaders' irritation with Mr Putin over Russia's actions in the Ukraine conflict. Mr Putin left the summit early following his frosty reception, the koala hugging having provided a rare lighter moment. Hundreds of koalas have been killed in secret by wildlife officials in Victoria due to concerns over starvation . Victoria's Environment Minister Lisa Neville said on Wednesday that the state government had asked experts to advise on the management of koalas at Cape Otway, about 230km southwest of Melbourne. She wouldn't rule out future koala culls, if recommended by the expert panel but said in the future the culls wouldn’t be kept secret. 'My main priority is making sure that we reduce the suffering of koalas due to starvation,' Ms Neville said. Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow this week on March 4 . US President Barack Obama also met Jimbelung the koala at the G20 in Brisbane . The Victorian government euthanised 686 koalas at Cape Otway, about 230km southwest of Melbourne . Cape Otway koalas can't be moved from their native habitat because they overeat and die, she said. Premier Daniel Andrew said the cull happened some years ago, not under the current government, and there should have been more transparency. The koalas were reportedly killed via lethal injection after being captured in trees. Koalas suffering starvation were euthanised, while healthy koalas were released back into the wild and healthy females were treated with control hormone implants. Animal activists are furious and have condemned the government for their 'cruel' treatment of koalas and questioned why the program was conducted in secret. Wildlife Victoria chief executive Karen Masson couldn't understand why the cull was kept quiet. 'If they had good, sound expert advice and had adequately explored all other options then they should have been forthcoming with what they were doing and why,' she said in a statement. Australian Koala Foundation chief Deborah Tabart OAM said she had heard rumours that koalas were being killed but had never had proof until now. 'I want somebody charged,' Ms Tabart said. 'The Australian government over my whole career has said there will never be a cull in Australia ever. 'It's cruel and mean to koalas and pays no respect for the role they play in tourism - how dare they treat this animal with that sort of level of disrespect. Australian Koala Foundation chief Deborah Tabart OAM questioned why the program was conducted in secret . 'And if they are so proud of what they were doing why was it done in secret?' Koala expert Dr Desley Whisson, who advised the government on the euthanasia program, said that the objective was to humanely deal with suffering koalas rather than reduce population size. Ms Tabart said more should have been done in previous years to stop the problem from escalating . 'Watching an animal starve to death is a horrible thing,' Dr Whisson, from Deakin University, told Daily Mail Australia. 'For every one koala that was euthanised there were probably two or three that starved without intervention. 'It at least was a good thing to put them out of their misery.' Dr Whisson said moving the population to other areas or conducting fertility control programs were expensive options. 'A lot of people ask why we can't just move the koalas somewhere else, but I think it's important to recognise the translocation koalas often has a negative impact,' she said. 'A large number would die, and they don't want to move from manna gum. 'It's sort of a lose-lose situation all round.' Dr Whisson said the problem in the manna gum woodland at Cape Otway was caused after koalas were introduced to the area in the 1980s from French Island. 'Manna gum is a very good food source for koalas, it's low in toxins and high in nutrients so koalas love it,' she said. 'To the point where they don't move for the food supply. 'Koalas can move one or two kilometres in a night but in this population, they stay in these manna gum areas and numbers build up.' Ms Tabart said more should have been done in previous years to prevent the problem from escalating. The problem in the manna gum woodland at Cape Otway was caused after koalas were introduced to the area in the 1980s from French Island . The koalas, many of which were starving, were killed via lethal injection after being captured in tree . 'Instead of doing this why didn't they plant trees all those years ago?' she said . 'They could have taken young ones out and relocated them. 'They've done nothing – they've watched until the problem becomes immense and then gone ""Oh we better do something let's kill them."" 'It's easy to say we had to put them out of their misery – they shouldn't have got to that misery in first place.' At Cape Otway there are up to 11 koalas per hectare, but the sustainable density is less than one koala per hectare. The cull is said to have occurred in secret to avoid a backlash from activists and locals . Koala expert Dr Desley Whisson, who advised the government on the euthanasia program, stressed that the objective was to humanely deal with suffering koalas rather than reduce population size . Victorian Environment Minister Lisa Neville said she was putting in place a koala management program to deal with the 'a very challenging and complex issue'. 'It is clear it's an overpopulation issue and it is clear that we have had koalas suffer in that Cape Otway area because of ill health and starvation,' Ms Neville told ABC. 'That's just not good enough and that's a terrible way to treat koalas. 'I'm wanting to make sure that we're taking the best action we can in this terrible situation of overpopulation. 'I don't want to see koalas suffer.' The koala is listed as 'vulnerable' in New South Wales, Queensland and the ACT and as 'rare' in South Australia but it has no official listing in Victoria.","Russian embassy in Australia posted their koala concern on Facebook .

"Best watch your back hipster London eateries; there's new kid on the block coming to take your crown. Cashing in on the trend for single-item menu restaurants, Melt Room, which only serves toasties - or 'melts' as they are known -  is set to open its doors in Soho this May. The menu will offer a variety of sandwiches, from the classic grilled cheese which will set you back £4.50 to more upmarket fillings such as slow-cooked lamb shoulder with mustard dressed greens. The Melt Room, which only serves toasties such as the classic grilled cheese sandwich (pictured) is set to open its doors in Soho this May . The grilled cheese sandwich shop follows in the footsteps of the UK's other single-item restaurants – Porridge Cafe in Old Street, London; Simply Crispy in Belfast which serves crisp sandwiches, and Brick Lane's Cereal Killer Cafe. The menu is currently being finalised but there will approximately be four breakfast toasties or 'melts' as they will be called, and six signature melts . The 12-seater cafe will also serve seasonal specials and 'hero melts' with unique cheeses. All combinations are served between hand-made, organic, sourdough bread from London's local Wapping bakery and use free-range Native Breeds meat from Gloucestershire. Sides such as crisp pickles, relish, cheese-friendly sauces and cheese on toast popcorn will be available to 'heighten the experience'. Melt Room will also serve luxury toasties such as this pulled lamb melt with mustard dressed greens . The cafe is the brainchild of self-confessed grilled cheese aficionado Andrey Datsenko who wanted to 'fix his own grilled cheese cravings.' Mr Datsenko said: 'I spent the better part of my youth studying hospitality management in New York and very quickly became addicted to the delicious and hearty grilled cheese sandwiches the city had to offer. 'I am very excited to launch Melt Room, not only to fix my own grilled cheese cravings, but to offer Londoners a gourmet American-inspired version of this much loved snack.' Nik Williamson who runs The Porridge Cafe . The menu includes the Classic – the holiest of grilled cheese sandwiches made with Keens sharp cheddar double slices; slow and low lamb shoulder with mustard dressed greens and melted Swiss, and rare roast beef coupled with Sparkenhoe red Leicestershire. The shop will open from 7am for breakfast, lunch and dinner, with 12 seats available for guests to enjoy a quick meal accompanied by cheesy tunes. And don't fret if you can't get yourself a seat – they're also introducing a local delivery service. Melt Room follows on the heels of Old Street's Porridge Cafe, Simply Crispy in Belfast which serves crisp sandwiches and Brick Lane's Cereal Killer Cafe . The Porridge Cafe - from the founders of The Bow Street Kitchen Nik Wiliamson and Elly Harrington - opened in early March and serves 25 types of porridge made from 11 different grains. Prices range from £2.35 for a bowl of basic porridge to £7 for the more hearty versions, with meat and vegetable toppings. The cafe serves both sweet and savoury versions of the traditional breakfast dish. Just crisps: Businessman Andrew McMenamin opened Belfast's Simply Crispy in January 2015 . In December 2014 self-confessed cereal obsessives Alan and Gary Keery launched the UK’s first cereal cafe featuring 120 cereals, 20 types of toppings and 12 varieties of milk. The identical twins’ establishment opened in Brick Lane, London and offers a menu of over 100 cereals from around the world. The duo came under fire when they first opened their cafe, for charging £3.20 for a bowl of cereal. The single-item cafe movement is not just confined to London. Belfast's Simply Crispy which opened earlier in January was the brainchild of businessman Andrew McMenamin who had planned to keep his pop-up going for just four weeks. But with diners queuing down the street to get their hands on the snacks, which have sold out every day, the cafe will now stay open and could even expand to other shops in Northern Ireland, Dublin, or London. Alan and Gary Keery of The Cereal Killer Cafe in Brick Lane serve 120 cereals with 20 toppings and 12 milks . 'We have managed to sell out every day - not the crisps though, the bread, the baps.

"The chief White House spokesman denied having any knowledge of the criminal charges that are reportedly being brought against New Jersey lawmaker Bob Menendez on Monday and used the lack of awareness as proof positive that the alleged investigation is a form of political payback. 'I cant speak to the accuracy of those claims,' the president's spokesman, Josh Earnest, said when asked about a news report claiming that federal prosecutors are  preparing to bring criminal corruption charges against the Democratic senator. And just because its been reported in the press, well, 'that's not proof of them being a fact,' he said. 'I don't know if there's a Menendez investigation.' 'If there is a criminal investigation on the way, it is one that had been done wholly separate and apart from any sort of political interference,' he stated. THE SENATOR: Sen. Bob Menendez, a New Jersey Democrat, may soon face criminal charges related to alleged corruption . POLITICS: (l-r) Menendez, donor Salomon Melgen, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, and her husband Paul, posed in February 2012 at a National Association of Latino Elected and Appointed Officials gala . CNN reported on Friday that a grand jury probe that has lasted two years was reaching a crescendo, and prosecutors, under pressure to complete their work before the statute of limitations runs out, would soon bring charges against Menendez that stem from his relationship with Florida eye doctor Salomon Melgen, a wealthy and prolific donor. The senator's aides admitted in 2013 that he had intervened a year earlier with the acting chief of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services on his friend's behalf, pushing back against accusations of overbilling the Medicare system by $8.9 million. Menendez has also repaid Melgen $58,500 for the value of plane trips he took on the doctor's private jet, mostly to the posh Dominican Republic resot Casa de Campo. The senator has fiercely denied he has done anything illegal, and one of his conservative colleagues in the Senate, Ted Cruz, has suggested the investigation is politically motivated. Menendez told reporters on Friday, I have 'always conducted myself appropriately and in accordance with the law. 'I am not going anywhere,' he promised. Tricia Enright, Menendez's communications director, told Daily Mail Online in a statement that 'the facts will ultimately confirm' that his behavior was in no way improper. 'The Senator has counted Dr. Melgen as one of his closest personal friends for decades,' Enright said. 'The two have spent holidays together and have gone to each other’s family funerals and weddings and have exchanged personal gifts.' She called the investigation's beginnings 'suspect,' referring to 'false allegations' that have been 'discredited' in the past. 'The timing seems awfully coincidental,' Cruz said of the probe on Saturday while speaking to reporters. 'The very week when Bob Menendez showed incredible courage to speak out and call out President Obama for the damage that his policy was doing to our national security,' is the same week reports that he'll be charged came out. That's 'troubling,' Cruz said. Menendez, 61, has seen pressure from the Obama administration over his positions on Cuba and Iran. Speaking to reporters on Saturday after an appearance at the Iowa Ag Summit, Cruz said the timing of the charges 'seems awfully coincidental.' COY: Asked Monday about the alleged probe, White House spokesman Josh Earnest said, 'I don't know if there's a Menendez investigation' The same week Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu 'came to Washington, spoke in Congress about the enormous threat of President Obama's misguided deal with Iran,' he said, and 'the very week when Bob Menendez showed incredible courage to speak out and call out President Obama for the damage that his policy was doing to our national security,' is the same week reports that he'll be charged came out. That's 'troubling,' the Texas lawmaker said. South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham made a similar observation at Saturday's event, according to CNN. 'They leaked a story about an impending indictment right after the [American Israeli Public Affairs Committee] conference, right after Bob Menendez said, to his great credit, stood up and said I want to look at any deal you with Iran,' Graham charged. 'As to Bob Menendez, like every other American, he's innocent until proven otherwise. He's a friend. But this whole behavior around the Obama administration regarding the law is very disturbing.' Attorney General Eric Holder, according to the network, has already given his approval. But he insisted 'I can't comment on that' when a reporter asked him about the report Friday afternoon after Obama gave a speech in South Carolina. Asked Monday about the alleged investigation, Earnest said, 'We don't know whether or not they're true.' 'I'm not going to comment on them for that reason.' 'The other reason I'm loathe to comment on this is that there is a principle this administration takes very seriously,' and that is 'ensuring that prosecutions are kept separate and apart from political interference or even the appearance of political interference.' 'That undermines the claims of a lot of people, including apparently Sen. Cruz,' he stated. Menendez's first high-level meeting at HHS related to Melgen's Medicare troubles occurred on June 7, 2012, according to court documents seen by the New Jersey Law Journal. The government alleges that the senator and some of his staffers met with Marilyn Tavenner, who was then in charge of the agency's Medicare and Medicaid subagency. Court papers also indicate Menendez followup up the meeting with a phone call, and then took Nevada Sen. Harry Reid, who was then the Senate Majority Leader, to an August 2, 2012 meeting with the Department of Health and Human Services's then-secretary, Kathleen Sebelius. CNN reported that Melgen was one of the Medicare system's most-reimbursed doctors nationwide, during the years when he was also a major donor to Menendez and to the Majority PAC. That political action committee, run by former Reid staffers, collected more than $700,000 from Melgen and made sure $600,000 of it benefited Menendez’s re-election campaign. Meanwhile, the conservative activist group American Commitment has called on Menendez to resign his office. On a new website called ByeBob.com, the group claims he 'unethically, and likely criminally, compromised his ability to represent the people of New Jersey.' The senator, now the ranking Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and its chairman until two months ago, has become a thorn in the White House's side by taking positions that grate on President Obama. Menendez opposed the president's rapprochement with Cuban strongman Raul Castro, saying in December that his actions 'have vindicated the brutal behavior of the Cuban government.' He has stood in the way of the State Department's negotiations with Iran, threatening to lead Congress in imposing new sanctions on the Islamic Republic if it doesn't shelve its nuclear ambitions. The White House has insisted the Iranians can be trusted to keep their end of any bargain. 'I have to be honest with you,' Menendez said during a January 21 Capitol Hill hearing. 'The more I hear from the administration and its quotes, the more it sounds like talking points that come straight out of Tehran.' While he is not among the senate's super-rich elites, the New Jersey legislator will likely have the capital on hand to fight the charges: His legal defense fund has already collected, and spent, more than $1 million. Last week two of his Senate aides tried to avoid testifying before the federal grand jury in the case, arguing that the senator's actions, and theirs, are protected by the U.S. Constitution's 'Speech or Debate' clause. Those words in America's founding document shield federal lawmakers and their offices from executive branch scrutiny, including Justice Department investigations, while they are actively working on legislation. THE DOCTOR: Salomon Melgen, a wealthy Florida ophthalmologist and a major Menendez donor, was ordered to pay back Medicare for $8.9 million in overbillings, and Menendez intervened with HHS for him . SEARCH WARRANT: A January 30 raid of Melgen's medical practice yielded van-loads of boxes containing medical and billing records and computer files . According to the New Jersey Law Journal, aide Michael Barnard refused to answer 50 questions about Menendez's conversations with Sebelius and Tavenner, and also declined to talk to the grand jury about contact between the senator's office and Melgen's lawyer-lobbyist about those conversations. Another more senior aide, former Menendez chief counsel Kerri Talbot, reportedly refused to testify about a separate matter. The grand jury wanted to know if Talbot had emailed a staffer at U.S. Customs and Border Protection to ask the agency to stop donating used port-screening equipment – principally cargo-container x-ray machines – to the Dominican Republic. Melgen, the senator's donor, controlled a company that offered similar equipment and wanted a contract proposal with the island nation to go through. The x-ray machines are used by customs and port security officials to screen cargo for narcotics and other contraband. NARCO-POLITICS: Dr. Melgen controlled a company that wanted a Dominican ports contract to sell x-ray equipment used to screen cargo containers for drugs. Menendez allegedly helped ensure the U.S. wouldn't provide the machines for free . In 2013 FBI agents and investigators from HHS raided Melgen's West Palm Beach, Florida medical office, Vitreo-Retinal Consultants. Over a period of nearly 24 hours, then executed search warrants and came out with dozens of boxes containing what news reports later described as medical and billing records and computer files. The Washington Post reported at the time that HHS auditors had raised red flags over the large number of eye surgeries and laser treatments Melgen's practice billed to Medicare. Other news reports described an alleged scheme in which Melgen used leftover fluid from single-use injection vials to treat two or three additional patients, billing Medicare for a new vial with each treatment. The government typically paid $2,000 for each container, raising the possibility that Melgen could have overbilled Medicare between $4,000 and $6,000 per vial.","New Jersey Sen. Bob Menendez will  be charged soon, news report said . Federal grand jury has been probing whether he traded political donations from eye doctor Salomon Melgen for improper government favors . Menendez spokeswoman says doctor has been 'one of his closest friends for decades' and insists everything he did was lawful . 'I am not going anywhere,' the Democratic senator said Friday . His aides refused to testify before a federal grand jury about conversations their boss had with HHS officials and a lawyer engaged to lobby for Melgen .

"Former Barcelona forward Ronaldinho has been dropped by Mexican side Queretaro while unhappy supporters have dubbed him 'Robberdinho' for producing sub-par displays amid media reports of too much partying. The Brazilian signed for the club in September but has only showed glimpses of the form that won him two FIFA World Player of the Year awards with Barca in 2004 and 2005. Ronaldinho missed a penalty on his debut and has been unable to win over the fans since. Ronaldinho has been dropped by Mexican side Queretaro following a string of poor performances . The former Barcelona forward has also come under scrutiny for his lavish off-field lifestyle . He was axed for Sunday's game at Toluca by new coach Victor Manuel Vucetich, a renowned disciplinarian, after he reportedly missed training in the week. Queretaro lost 1-0 and are second from bottom in the league with eight points from 10 games. 'They (the fans) are calling him 'Robberdinho' ... and it is undeniable the Brazilian star's time in Mexican football has left a lot to be desired where it matters most: on the field,' said the Estadio newspaper. 'The world champion has not dropped his party lifestyle in the land of the Aztecs.' Ronaldinho, who turns 35 next week, has always been known for his love of night life but Queretaro appear to be losing patience with him. An executive who declined to be identified told Reuters the club had no intention of extending his two-year contract and expected him to head to the United States once his time in Mexico was over. In 2005, Ronaldinho was crowned FIFA's Ballon d'Or winner for his fantastic form for Barcelona .

"The ladies who lunch at the Ascot Bar of the Pennyhill Park Hotel were oblivious that one of the most decorated English footballers had just strolled in. At 6ft 4in, Chelsea and England centre-back Gary Cahill ought to be hard to miss, especially when he is the national team’s vice-captain, having picked up pretty much every club honour in the game. Win the Premier League in May and he will have the full set - following Champions League, Europa League, FA Cup and League Cup success in little more than three years. Yet he goes relatively unnoticed while the likes of John Terry, or his old Chelsea team-mate Frank Lampard, both with similar achievements to their name, would be stopped in their tracks. Gary Cahill went relatively unnoticed during an interview with the Mail on Sunday at the Pennyhill Park hotel . Chelsea defender Cahill has picked up nearly every club honour in the game, including the Champions League . ‘If you’d said to me four or five years ago I would be in this position I’d have snapped your hands off,’ says Cahill, 29. ‘It’s an amazing feeling. I often think about how lucky I am and how so many people would love to be in this position.’ Since arriving at Stamford Bridge from Bolton in January 2012, the medals and trophies have simply kept on coming. ‘Moving to Chelsea has been such a success in terms of the titles I have won in three years,’ he says. ‘The winning mentality of the club rubs off on the players and you just want to win even more.’ Cahill poses with the Champions League trophy and the FA Cup after Chelsea completed the double in 2012 . The former Bolton and Aston Villa centre back holds aloft the Europa League trophy in Amsterdam a year later . A week ago, Cahill added a Capital One Cup winner’s medal as Chelsea clinched the first major silverware of season in a 2-0 victory over Tottenham at Wembley. ‘It was almost like the lads were bouncing into training the following day,’ he recalls. ‘Winning anything is special to [Jose] Mourinho. It’s his first trophy since he returned. ‘There was very little celebration considering we had just won a competition. My family had come down from the north to watch the game and they all stayed at my house. There’s no better feeling than driving home from Wembley to my family at home.’ Cahill added the Capital One Cup trophy to his haul last week as Chelsea defeated Tottenham 2-0 at Wembley . Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho is all smiles as he and his team celebrate after landing their latest silverware . Cahill (centre) appears highly amused as Mourinho throws himself to the floor during the celebrations . But with the Champions League and Barclays Premier League high on Chelsea’s agenda, it is ‘back to business’ as Cahill says. Mourinho keeps stoking up the warrior-like instincts in his team and Cahill believes that, aside from the manager’s meticulous pre-match planning, two key elements are contributing to the team’s success this season. ‘We’ve learned from our experiences,’ he says. ‘We played several teams last season where people expected us to get results but we didn’t. Having that in the back of your mind going into the season has helped, you don’t want to go through that again — you don’t want to waste opportunities.’ The second key factor is the quality of signings who joined the club in the past two transfer windows — including Cesc Fabregas and one of the best strikers in Europe, Diego Costa. Cahill says Chelsea learnt from setbacks last season and insists the club do not want to waste opportunities . Diego Costa arrived at Chelsea from Atletico Madrid and is one of the Premier League's most-feared strikers . Former Arsenal midfielder Cesc Fabregas, signed from Barcelona, has formed a connection with Costa . ‘Diego has come in and although he hardly speaks any English, had never played in this league before and has never lived in this country, he had an impact from the word go. ‘Time and again players come over and take a long time to settle down and get into the groove of the Premier League but it hasn’t fazed him. He’s one of the liveliest jokers in the changing room. He’s certainly entertaining and he has settled into the group really well. ‘With Cesc, everyone knew his quality and he has played in this League before so in a way it was easy for him to come back. But still, he has come into the side like he has never been away and the connection Costa and Fabregas have had this season has been fantastic for us. ‘There’s also the likes of Filipe Luis, who has come in and done tremendously well. There’s a real fight on at left-back. It’s one of those positions where we’re blessed. You know whoever plays is going to do the job. ‘Kurt Zouma is another great talent, he listens to everybody and he takes on advice. He’s a nice lad and a fantastic player. Playing at a club like Chelsea and being given the opportunity to play with the world-class players that we have means you can learn from them and improve your game.’ Chelsea centre backs Gary Cahill, captain John Terry and  Kurt Zouma celebrate together at Wembley . Cahill had to take some flak after Tottenham’s Harry Kane inspired a 5-3 win over Chelsea on New Year’s Day, but he takes such criticism as ‘part and parcel of the game,’ and points out that ‘there isn’t a footballer on the planet who hasn’t received negative press’ at some stage in their career. ‘You need to have a thick skin at times, especially at the highest level. I am constantly analysing my performances and I tend to focus more on things I haven’t done as well as I’d have liked. I always look to improve and that’s what’s got me to where I am today.’ Cahill’s greatest day in Chelsea colours came in the Champions League victory over Bayern Munich in 2012. Now he is playing his part in their bid to repeat the feat, and his magnificently timed flick, from a Terry cross, led to Branislav Ivanovic’s header putting Chelsea in front against Paris Saint-Germain at the Parc des Princes in the first leg of their last 16 tie last month. Branislav Ivanovic celebrates after scoring for Chelsea against Paris Saint-Germain in the Champions League . Cahill's flick from Terry's cross at the Parc des Princes led to Ivanovic's important goal in the French capital . ‘It was a crazy situation because we found all three of us in the box and nobody else,’ recalls Cahill. ‘JT played it to me and I knew Ivanovic was coming in behind me. I couldn’t score from that angle so I tried to help it on and he did the rest.’ On Wednesday, Chelsea host PSG in the return leg, with the tie 1-1, and it’s a mouthwatering challenge. ‘It’s got that final-feel about it because if you lose the game you’re out — and you have to really push hard to win the game. The atmosphere on European nights is something special and that’s another positive with the second leg being played at home, the fans are our 12th man. Have we got the squad and the players to win it again? Yes we have.’",Gary Cahill has won Champions League and Europa League with Chelsea . The defender has also landed the FA Cup and Capital One Cup with Blues . England vice-captain could complete set with Premier League title .,ad2a08a296c946c71e11ba3726b7b55757c66770
"It has been a sci-fi dream for decades - a car that can simply take to the air to avoid traffic. However, a Slovakian firm has said it has finally cracked the problem - and it will sell in it just two years. The AeroMobil can fly 430 miles on a tank of petrol - and when its wings fold down, it'll fit into a normal parking space. Scroll down for video . Aeromobil is a 'flying car' that can fit in a standard parking space, and could both take off and land at any airport in the world. When in flight mode, it can go 430 miles, reaching 124mph - but can fold up its wings to travel on the road and fit in a single parking space. Aeromobil is a 'flying car' that perfectly makes use of existing infrastructure created for automobiles and planes, and opens doors to real door-to-door travel,' the firm says. When in its car configuration, it can fit into a standard parking space, and it also takes normal fuel pumped at every service station. The latest version is the third generation of the craft. 'It is now finalised and has been in regular flight-testing program in real flight conditions since October 2014,' the firm said. At South By Southwest, Juraj Vaculik, co-founder and CEO of AeroMobil, spoke at a panel about the future of flying cars, predicting a world ahead in which these vehicles easily merge with existing transportation. He says it will be on sale in 2017, and that the firm was also developing a self driving (and flying) version. Tatiana Veber, an AeroMobil spokesman said: 'We have been developing the concept of a flying car since 1990. 'Our first model looked quite bizarre and it would have problems in the regular use. 'That was a signal to improve the concept of the flying car in a way to become an integral part of the regular road traffic. The winds fold behind the driver of the car when it is on the road . The car seats two, although the pilot will need a licence to fly it. 'We got a positive feedback from several experts in avionics, which appreciated design and the technical solution of the process of transformation. 'The car is constructed to be fuelled at regular gas stations using the fuel for Rotax 912 ULS engine.' AeroMobil says its third prototype is ready to be shown to the world this October 29th at the Pioneers Festival in Austria. When in plane mode, the craft is powered by a propeller . The firm has even completed the interior of the craft, and says it is undergoing advanced flight tests in Slovakia. However, design is still not perfect- the wings fold into the back seat behind the driver when in car mode. The firm has also released a video of it in action, driving through city streets then taking to the air. 'Aeromobil 3 is stylish, comfortable for both the driver and passenger, and exceptionally combines the performance of a sports car with qualities of an 'ultralight',' it says. The vehicle can reach 200km/h when in the air, and 160km/h on the roads.","AeroMobil can fly 430 miles on a tank of petrol . When its wings fold down, it can fit into a normal parking space .

"France set themselves up for their last-day showdown with title-chasing England at Twickenham by shutting out Italy in Rome yesterday. Coach Philippe Saint-Andre praised his side’s resilience after they bounced back from two successive defeats in the Six Nations to overcome Italy in a scrappy match. Les Bleus scored two tries and five penalties to seal an emphatic victory at the Stadio Olimpico after a dour first half in which a wet ball and rain-soaked pitch led both sides into a string of handling errors.

France went into the break leading 9-0 after two penalties from fly-half Camille Lopez and one from full-back Scott Spedding but broke away in the second half with tries from second-rower Yoann Maestri and replacement centre Mathieu Bastareaud.

In terms of commitment and aggression and defensively as well,’ Saint-Andre said, singling out flanker Thierry Dusautoir, celebrating his 50th match as captain. ‘Our scrum was of very high quality,’ the coach added. Dusautoir acknowledged that after defeats by Ireland and Wales, France were under pressure to produce ahead of the trip to Twickenham. ‘It was a big test today. In our last few matches, we weren’t able to find this defiance, or quality or this hunger,’ he said. ‘The first half maybe wasn’t very productive but it wore them down and it allowed us to end the match well,’ he said. Going in to the final weekend of the Six Nations, four teams - England, Ireland, Wales and France - are still in with a shout of claiming the trophy. Here's how each can be victorious.

"It looks like any other anonymous office building. But this nondescript garage in Sunnyvale, California, is where Apple is believed to be building its self driving 'Titan' cars. One blog claims the address is the HQ for the project which could one day take on Tesla. Scroll down for video . This office complex is believed to be home to Apple's secret car project. The building is advertised as home to a mysterious company named SixtyEight Research. Claims that Apple is building a car may seem like a leap, but it isn't the first time such projects have been discussed by the Californian firm. In an interview last year, Apple board member Mickey Drexler said that before his death in 2011 Steve Jobs had considered building a car. He told Paul Goldberger: 'Steve Jobs was gonna design an iCar. 'I think cars have an extraordinary opportunity for cool design.' 'Two people with knowledge of the project say Apple has been working on it and receiving shipments related to its development at a building just minutes from 1 Infinite Loop, in the town of Sunnyvale,' wrote AppleInsider. 'We can confirm that Apple does indeed have a large presence at the location, and that numerous automotive-related renovations, including an 'auto work area' and a 'repair garage,' have been constructed on the premises.' The building is advertised as home to a mysterious company named SixtyEight Research. Aside from a sparse website registered through GoDaddy less than a year ago that reveals virtually no information about the company, SixtyEight has no discernible online presence. 'We are experts in market research; helping companies find the relevant market data and industry analysis required to make informed decisions,' its site says. The building is apparently known as SG5 within Apple, and issues visitor passes identical to Apple's - minus the logo. Apple could have an electric car ready to go on sale by 2020, putting it in direct competition with rivals Tesla Motors and General Motors, according to an industry expert. Evidence is mounting that the tech giant is gearing up to revolutionise the automobile market, just as it did with smartphones and tablets. Images taken over the past few weeks have shown a prototype car that suggests Apple is testing the water - ahead of a release in as little as five years. When AppleInsider visited SixtyEight's headquarters at building '175' earlier this week, its windows were a 'frosted' opaque, and security cameras were visible outside. Bloomberg has claimed that Apple could have a car ready by 2020, based on images of a test car. After the first mysterious camera-mounted car was spotted in California last week, further sightings of Apple's minivans have been posted online, with equipment on top (shown here) According to Tim Higgins from Bloomberg, automakers 'typically spend five to seven years developing a car'. And a 2020 timeframe would underscore Apple's 'aggressive goals and could set the stage for a battle for customers with Tesla Motors Inc and General Motors Co.' Both of those are planning to release a sub-£26,000 ($40,000) electric car in 2017 that can travel more than 200 miles (320km) on a single charge. Steve LeVine, author of 'The Powerhouse,' a book about the automotive battery industry, said on Bloomberg TV Thursday: 'Was GM really going to be able to match Tesla? Apple can.' This latest speculation follows sightings of mysterious camera-mounted cars registered to Apple in the US last week. At least two videos - one recorded in California, another filmed in Florida - suggest the top-secret project is more widespread than first thought. And rumours range from a Street View-style mapping service to an electric car that will rival Tesla or a self-driving van to rival Google. The Californian footage was sent to MacRumors and shows a silver people-carrier driving down a street in Palo Alto. The Florida recording was filmed on a highway in Coral Springs and uploaded by Apple Insider. This footage shows a white Dodge Caravan fitted with cameras on the roof. As the filmmaker pulls alongside the van, they wave at the two men inside. The passenger is seen concealing an iPad from view, while the driver points to the camera and drives off. The Florida recording (pictured) was filmed in Coral Springs. This footage shows a white Dodge Caravan fitted with cameras on the roof. As the filmmaker pulls alongside the van, they wave at the two men inside and the passenger is seen concealing an iPad from view . Other reports have spotted the vans in Hawaii and Wisconsin. The latest vans haven't officially been confirmed as belonging to Apple, but the similarities with previous confirmed sightings suggests they are. The far-reaching nature of the project lends more weight to the claims Apple is developing a mapping service. With 12 cameras on top of the car, however, some have said that is too many for it to be a mapping car like Google's Street View. Plus, reports recently claimed Apple has several hundred employees developing an electric car at a secret lab. This project has been dubbed 'Titan'. This Apple research lab was reportedly set up late last year - meaning any car could still be years away -  and is being overseen by Apple designer Sir Jonathan Ive. Apple could, of course, be using the vans for both projects. The Wall Street Journal added that hundreds of employees are working on the Titan project and boss Tim Cook approved the project close to a year ago. The Californian footage (pictured) was sent to MacRumors and shows a silver people-carrier driving down a street in Palo Alto . These reports followed rumours that Apple was developing a vehicle as part of a project that 'will change the landscape and give Tesla a run for its money.' The claims were made in an email from an unnamed Apple employee. In an interview last year, Apple board member Mickey Drexler said that before his death in 2011, Steve Jobs had considered building a car. An unnamed Apple employee recently hinted that the tech giant is developing a vehicle as part of a project that 'will change the landscape and give Tesla a run for its money.'  It followed sightings of an Apple-owned car fitted with cameras (pictured) in California . In particular, Apple may be working on an electric car to rival Tesla's range (the Tesla P85D is pictured) or the email could be referring to an advanced iPhone in-car control system that would rival Tesla's software . The head of self-driving cars for Google expects real people to be using them on public roads in two to five years. Chris Urmson said the cars would still be test vehicles, and Google would collect data on how they interact with other vehicles and pedestrians. But Mr Urmson wouldn't give a date for putting driverless cars on roads en masse, saying that the system has to be safe enough to work properly. He told reporters last month at the Automotive News World Congress in Detroit that he wants to reach the point where his test team no longer has to pilot the cars. He told Paul Goldberger: 'Steve Jobs was gonna design an iCar. I think cars have an extraordinary opportunity for cool design.' Alternatively, the Apple employee's email could be referring to an advanced iPhone in-car control system that would rival Tesla's software. The original Dodge van with the equipment on the top was spotted by the blog Claycord in San Francisco. The blog owners apparently asked the driver what he was doing, but he refused to give an answer. The California Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) confirmed the vehicle was leased to Apple. Last year, footage emerged of a self-driving Dodge Caravan that looked like the current Apple minivans. When contacted by MailOnline, Apple declined to comment on the car in question or what its purpose was. With 12 cameras on top of the mysterious Apple car, some have said that is too many for it to be a mapping car like Google's Street View (pictured left). Google launched its Street View technology in 2007, and has refined the technology ever since (Street View screenshot near Trafalgar Square in London pictured right) Alternatively, the vehicles spotted in California and Florida could be self-driving cars. The cameras on the mysterious vans could be used to scan the road and help engineers develop autonomous software, for example. If Apple was developing such systems, they would would rival Google's self-driving cars (pictured)",Building registered as home to mysterious SixtyEight Research .

"One can only imagine the gloomy mood that must have collectively descended on the European Tour's headquarters at Wentworth last week when reading about the acts of selflessness of the new Masters champion, Jordan Spieth. Shortly after being presented with the green jacket, the man who has rapidly become everyone's favourite Texan flew to New York and gave 25 interviews over the course of 24 hours. Then, despite the obvious fatigue, he flew to South Carolina to keep his promise to play the Heritage tournament — his fourth event in a row — because, well, they were good to him on the way up and he wanted to pay them back. Jordan Spieth hits a tee shot on the eighth hole during the final round of the RBC Heritage Tournament . Spieth has competed in four events in a row as the new Masters champion shows his commitment to the sport . There was more. What about two tournaments coming up next month in his home state? Yes, I'll be playing because they're 'hometown events', he said. He also committed to the Cadillac Match Play Championship in San Francisco next week because it is a WGC event, and the Players Championship in Florida the following week because it is the tour's flagship competition. Now, by way of stark contrast, let's return to the European Tour and their flagship event, also being played next month when the BMW PGA Championship is staged at Wentworth. Given that Europeans won an unprecedented three majors last year plus the Ryder Cup, not surprisingly they wanted to put on quite a celebration. Spieth attends the 50th Academy Of Country Music Awards at the AT&T Stadium on Sunday night . The new Masters champion poses with singers Charles Kelley (centre) and Jake Owen (left) on Sunday night . Only trouble is, three of the high-profile members of that winning team at Gleneagles will not be present. Local favourite Ian Poulter, world No 3 Henrik Stenson and world No 10 Sergio Garcia have decided not to play. In the past all three have made no secret of the fact they don't care for Wentworth and all three have poor records in the event. Doesn't that make it an obvious event to cut from a busy schedule? You can see the argument. But, equally, as Spieth at the age of just 21 is effortlessly showing, sometimes it's simply about doing the right thing. Yes, Poulter and Stenson, in particular, can put forward persuasive cases as to how they do their bit for European golf. Poulter is doing plenty behind the scenes to ensure the relaunched British Masters at Woburn in October will be a great success; Stenson plays more tournaments round the world than any other top player and the nasty bout of flu that ruined his chance at the Masters was a sure sign he needs to cut back. All the same, the feeling lingers this admirable pair have got this one wrong. BMW have done a fabulous job with this tournament. It has grown to become an integral part of London's sporting summer. Ian Poulter watches his second shot on the first hole during the final round of the RBC Heritage Tournament . 'It may be my last Masters next year. The distance is ebbing away from this old body and the handwriting is on the wall.’ Not just his final Open this summer, but it looks as if 65-year-old Tom Watson is ready to call it a day at Augusta as well. This year he shot 71 in the first round to become the oldest player to break par in Masters history. He followed it by making the halfway cut in the Heritage tournament in South Carolina last week, and shooting 69 in the third round. Clearly, he’s determined to go out with head unbowed. The prize fund at €5million is handsome and the players are treated regally, with a top-class players' lounge and free accommodation thrown in at the five-star Coworth Park hotel in Ascot. Equally, they don't do this as an act of benevolence. They do this on the presumption that everyone will turn up. So imagine how they must be feeling. Yes, it will still be a great event with world No 1 Rory McIlroy and Masters runner-up Justin Rose competing, while American Patrick Reed is making his debut. But they could be forgiven for looking at the revived Irish Open the following week featuring just as many star names for less than half of their investment and taking place on one of the world's great golf courses in Royal County Down to boot, and questioning their largesse. Pleasing all tournament sponsors is, of course, an impossible task, even if Spieth appears determined to try. But there are some events where players ought to feel an obligation to play. Their own flagship event is surely one. Sweden's Henrik Stenson watches his tee shot on the fourth hole during the RBC Heritage Tournament . St Andrews will be Nick Faldo's last Open . Twenty-five years after his runaway victory at St Andrews, Sir Nick Faldo will play in his last Open at the Home of Golf this July. Thus, the greatest British player of the modern era will bow out over the Swilcan Bridge like so many of the American legends, such as Jack Nicklaus and Arnold Palmer. With innovative new grandstands dramatically increasing the capacity around the fabled 17th and 18th holes, it will be a fitting place to say goodbye in every sense. ‘I look forward to celebrating all that golf has given me as I cross that storied bridge,’ said Sir Nick, whose 58th birthday falls on the Saturday of the event. Legendary golfer Nick Faldo is set to make his final Open appearance at St Andrews in July when he turns 58 .","Shortly after being presented with his green jacket, new Masters champion Jordan Spieth gave 25 interviews over the course of 24 hours in New York . Then, despite his fatigue, the 21-year-old flew to South Carolina to keep a promise and play in the Heritage tournament - his fourth event in a row . By contrast, players on the European Tour have not shown the same sort of unwavering commitment to the sport . Ian Poulter, Henrik Stenson and Sergio Garcia have decided not to play at the BMW PGA Championship being staged at Wentworth next month .",e2a44a3e3edd44c394ad6ff7207980f7f1e9b4b3
"The parents of an 11-year-old autistic boy who miraculously survived four-and-a-half-days alone in the bush after he vanished from their favourite campground have vowed to continue holidaying at the camping spot. Luke Shambrook, who went without food or water since Good Friday, has been going to the Candlebark Campground at Lake Eildon National Park, northeast of Melbourne, since he was just one year old, his parents Rachel and Tim Shambrook revealed in an emotional press conference on Thursday. A desperate search for Luke in the park was mounted after he disappeared from the campground on Friday. The hunt ended on Tuesday when a police helicopter guided on-ground searchers to Luke's location. ‘One thing in his favour is he has been going there since he was one-year-old, every year he’s been up and down the hills and visiting the lake,’ Luke’s father Tim said. Scroll down for video . Rachel and Tim Shambrook thanked everyone for their efforts in helping to find their son Luke . Luke Shambrook's doctors are amazed he is in such a good condition considering he was missing without food and water for so long . His relieved mother Rachel added: ‘He has a real sense of belonging there. I guess that gave him lots of confidence but ultimately that place gives him lots of pleasure and that’s what we are on about regarding spending time there.’ His parents believe the communities prayers and Luke’s own resilience is what saw him survive the terrifying ordeal. ‘Sometimes we don’t give our kids enough credit for their resilience - but he sure showed us,’ Rachel said. The moment Luke was found was captured on video, he was seen peering out from behind trees before a uniformed police officer reached him and took his hand to reassure him he was finally safe. Tim said: ‘We admire everyone’s professionalism, determination and commitment to finding Luke.’ The 11-year-old autistic boy was found just three kilometres away from where went missing at Lake Eildon National Park - north-east of Melbourne .

Luke's parents revealed he has been going to the Candlebark Campground at Lake Eildon National Park, where he went missing, since he was just one year old . The couple vowed to take him back to the campground for more holidays. ‘He has a real sense of belonging there,' Rachel said . ‘We were acutely aware of the thousands of prayers… we felt them,’ Rachel said. The mother-of-three admitted: ‘We found it difficult to keep our hopes up.’ ‘He’s showed a side of him that we knew was there but his resilience has just blown us away,’ Rachel said. ‘To have such an amazing outcome it’s hard to express it in words.’ The parents are still at a loss to know how their son spent his long days alone in the Victorian bushland. ‘If only we could have a snapshot of what his time out there in the bush was like… the concept of trying to understand what he did and how he survived is beyond what we can imagine,’ Rachel said. ‘We’d like to have a glimpse of what he did at night.’ Luke Shambrook was lost for four nights alone in the Victorian bushland and on Wednesday he was reunited with his rescuers at Royal Children's Hospital in Melbourne . Doctors said on Wednesday they are stunned with how healthy Luke appeared when he was found. Sitting up in his hospital bed, the young boy was greeted by two people from the search and rescue team who made the dramatic find on Tuesday, just three kilometres from where he went missing at Lake Eildon National Park. Luke has been comforted by his family at Royal Children's Hospital in Melbourne and after suffering from exhaustion, dehydration and hypothermia when he was found. He is unlikely to suffer any long term effects from his traumatic ordeal. A camera on the helicopter captured the dramatic moment rescuers reached Luke on the fourth day of an increasingly desperate search . A police officer was first on the site, and he knelt down and offered Luke reassurance he was finally safe . Other rescuers quickly followed, with one wrapping the terrified boy in a foil blanket, before he was gently taken from the bush to where he could receive proper medial attention . Paediatrician Amy Gray said Luke was still a bit weak and tired, but asking for food. His parents revealed he had eaten some Weetabix on Thursday and tasted his first Easter egg after completely missing the occasion over the weekend. 'It's an amazingly happy outcome after what has clearly been an incredibly stressful, traumatic experience,' Dr Gray said on Wednesday. 'I don't know that any of us know exactly what he's been through, but ... we think he's doing fabulously for someone who has been through what we can only imagine, and certainly in much better condition than what we'd expect.' Dr Gray said he was improving with each hour and doctors did not expect him to have any ongoing physical problems from the ordeal. 'Aside from the dehydration he's tired and weak, again as you would expect, but there's no other real major physical issues at this stage,' she said. Luke Shambrook has been found alive after he went missing from the Candlebark Campground near Lake Eildon on Friday . He suffered from dehydration and hypothermia but has been reunited with his mother Rachel (pictured left) His parents Tim and Rachel were reunited with Luke as he was put into an ambulance in a stretcher, with his mother giving him a kiss . Luke was found just before midday AEST on Tuesday in bushland off Skyline Road, 3km from the campsite . 'He seems very content and settled in the ward and happily interacting with the family.' Luke's autism and limited speech could mean he never reveals what happened. 'He may have been wandering around lost and clocking up the k's,' Acting Assistant Police Commissioner Rick Nugent told Fairfax Radio on Wednesday. 'I'm not sure we'll ever know.' Mr Nugent on Tuesday said Luke's survival in the cold, wet, rugged terrain was a miracle. SES spokesman Brent Sergeant said the more days that passed during the search for Luke, the harder it became for volunteers. But finding the boy's beanie on Monday and realising he had walked away from water, rather than toward it, lifted their spirits. When his parents were reunited with Luke as he was put into an ambulance his mother gave him a big kiss. Luke gave his father Tim a 'big thumbs up' when they saw each other, the family said. 'When the rescue team found him, he was in high spirits and was walked out of the bush on his own two feet,' they said in a statement. 'The family are very happy to be reunited.'

"More than 70 years ago these five men each played their own vital role in the Normandy campaign that began with the D-Day landings. Two were just teenagers, another was a young sapper, one a rookie tank driver and the last was a veteran of jungle warfare. All ordinary young men doing their bit to help liberate France. Until now their exploits have escaped the attention of historians, but yesterday these veterans of World War Two stood proudly side by side after being awarded France’s highest decoration, the Legion d’Honneur. Courageous veterans are given France's highest honour for their vital role on D-Day in a ceremony at Yorkshire Air Museum, Left to Right: Gordon Collinson, Eric Gerald Briscoe, Thomas William Wright, Eric Gill, James Denwood and Catherine Rush who was accepting the Honour on behalf of her late husband Bernard Rush . Conducting the ceremony at the Yorkshire Air Museum at Elvington, near York, the French Ambassador Sylvie Bermann told the frail veterans: ‘I am here in recognition of your heroic accomplishments in the liberation of France and to honour your bravery and dedication.’ Aged between 90 and 99, they are among the first of 2,800 living veterans who will receive the Legion of Honour in the months to come. The decision was announced by French President Francois Hollande following last summer’s 70th anniversary celebrations and the ambassador said: ‘France will keep its promise.’ Although the memories are now fading, this group of humble soldiers - along with the widow of a veteran who died recently - couldn’t hide their pride as they received what will probably be the last medal of their extraordinary lives. Eric Gill (right), a veteran of the Burma campaign who landed on a beach in Normandy, pictured during the liberation of France . GERRY BRISCOE was a butcher when he joined up at 18, a year later he was putting his life on the line by storming a Normandy beach. It was his first ever action and a terrifying experience for a hardened veteran let alone a youngster. A sapper with the Royal Engineers, he owes his life to a stroke of luck. ‘On D-Day I should have been the last one in the boat to be the first one out because I was carrying a charge to blow up a pill box,’ he recalled. ‘I miscounted so I finished up the first one in the boat and so the last one out. The lad that got out the boat first drowned straight away because the boat went over him. There for the grace of God, I was saved.’. Battle was raging when Mr Briscoe reached shore and discovered the pill box had already been blown up by a shell, but there were chaotic scenes all around. ‘The Germans were still firing at us and there were shells firing all over the place and the rockets from the big main ships were going over to the Germans.’ He said: ‘You are frightened to death really, I remember it well.’ The teenager helped build a bridge in the days that followed and continued working on bridges and roads to help Allied troops as they headed for Germany. He was among the first troops into Brussels and recalled the local citizens coming out with bowls of warm water, because the soldiers were covered in dirt, and meat sandwiches. After the war he returned to working as a butcher. He married wife Jean, now 86, and the couple had two children. Mr Briscoe, 90, from Bradford, said of the honour: ‘I am very pleased about it. I have gone to France regularly over the years and received medals but this one is the top of the shop. France's highest award, the Legion of Honour, is pinned on James Denwood by Her Excellency Madame Sylvie Berman . The Legion of Honour medals for the five veterans aged between 90 and 99 who are among the first of 2,800 living veterans who will receive the Legion of Honour in the months to come . BILL WRIGHT was a fresh-faced 19-year-old recruit and D-Day was his first experience of warfare. ‘People don’t realise that for about half the forces on D-Day it was their first action,’ he said. Mr Wright said he recalled being extremely sea sick on the way over as the seas were choppy. He was on one of the American landing craft and remembered ‘the chap in charge was absolutely brilliant.’ ‘He was not much older than me and looked like a young President Kennedy. He was cool as a cucumber and put us ashore almost dry.’ Mr Wright was in the Staffordshire Yeomanry who came ashore in the ‘second wave’ of troops. Fortunately for him he was inside a tank – working as the radio operator and loader. His tank was stuck in a ‘traffic jam on the beach’ as there were few exits amid the fierce battle. ‘We were too busy to be frightened,’ he said. ‘Everybody was very conscious we were making history. As a young lad out of school it was a most terrific adventure.’ Mr Wright stayed in Normandy for two months before returning to England to re-train to work in amphibious tanks. In the winter of 1944 he saw further action in Holland and then moved into Germany in the final months of the war. ‘My tank was knocked out but fortunately none of us were hurt,’ he said. Her Excellency Madame Sylvi awarded Frances highest honour the Legion dHonneur at the Yorkshire Air Museum . After the war he married his childhood sweetheart Margaret. They had three children and he worked in forestry. Commenting on yesterday’s award, the 90-year-old widower from York said: ‘It’s a great honour, but there are far more deserving souls who didn’t get it.’ ERIC GILL was a veteran of the Burma campaign when he landed on a beach in Normandy. Later, when the action moved to Holland, he had an astonishing escape when shrapnel pierced his helmet and ‘scalped him.’ The Private with the King’s Own Yorkshire Light Infantry suffered a six inch wound on his head and couldn’t see for the blood streaming over his face, but he survived to tell the tale. Born in Doncaster and one of nine children, he left school at 14 to work down the pit. The teenage miner worked with the pit ponies. At 19, with the Nazi threat growing, he joined the army and was in Burma when war broke out. His wartime adventures saw him escape the horrors of the Burmese jungle by walking 400 miles to India, then travel to Australia with 1,000 Italian prisoners of war and on to New York before returning to ‘Blighty.’ He arrived in Normandy four days after D-Day and headed across mainland Europe on the push for victory. Mr Gill, 99, married wife Doris and had two children. He had various jobs, including being a plasterer and graveyard worker, before retiring. Gordon Collinson talks to his Air Cadet grandson Alfie Tomlinson at the award ceremony at the Yorkshire Air Museum . GORDON COLLINSON should have been in the relative safety of a tank when he landed on Gold Beach. Unfortunately, his tank broke down and couldn’t get off the landing craft. The 20-year-old tank driver was forced to wade ashore carrying his rifle around his head as bullets flew all around him. A man of small stature, the water was up to his nose at one point, but he was grabbed by his comrades and managed to survive the terrifying experience. He eventually found a tank to board so he could continue with his duties. Mr Collinson ended up battling his way across France and going into the heart of Germany during the final months of the war. He was among the Allied troops to reach Berlin in May 1945 after the Russians arrived first and witnessed the scenes of terrible devastation. After the war he married and had three children and spent the rest of his working life as a civil servant. He is now aged 91 and living in York. JAMES DENWOOD was lucky to survive the early stages of the war to take part in the Normandy invasion. He was on board the troopship and former Cunard liner the Lancastria when it was sunk in June 1940 as it evacuated exhausted soldiers from northern France. Around 5,000 died but Mr Denwood was among the lucky ones and survived. ‘It went down in 20 minutes,’ he recalled yesterday. ‘I was like a duck and had to swim.’ The veterans of World War Two stood proudly side by side after being awarded France’s highest decoration, the Legion d’Honneur . The Legion of Honour medals were awarded after an announcement by French President Francois Hollande following last summer’s 70th anniversary celebrations and the ambassador said: ‘France will keep its promise' He was a sapper in the Royal Engineers during the D-Day landings and was designated to work on a fuel pipeline - ensuring the Allied forces could maintain total air supremacy. He married wife Edith during the war and the eldest of his three children was born in 1944. When the fighting ended he returned to Cumbria to work in the quarries and eventually moved down to South Yorkshire to work in a steel works. He is now aged 97 and living in Mexborough, South Yorkshire. BERNARD RUSH was a chief petty officer in the navy and turned 21 five days before D-Day. He was an engineer whose job was to repair damaged vehicles. After the war he returned to working in the cotton mills at Silsden, West Yorkshire, and rose to become a manager. Mr Rush died last September aged 91 but the French government took the ‘exceptional’ decision to give the father-of-four the promised award posthumously. His widow Catherine, 83, collected it for him and said: ‘He would have been over the moon and so proud.’","Group are the first living veterans of 2,800 to receive the Legion of Honour .

"A Saudi Arabian citizen has captured intense footage of a sandstorm sweeping its way across a street, engulfing everything in its path. Sandstorms caused havoc in Saudi Arabia last week with a number of flights being cancelled and schools being forced to close. Car crashes were also reported in other areas as parts of the Arabian Peninsula   were plunged into darkness. Strong winds are believed to have caused the disruption, which resulted in nearby Dubai’s skyline almost disappearing and people suffering from respiratory problems. The footage, captured on camera in Saudi Arabia by Mohammed Mohsen, shows the sandstorm sweeping into the area in which he stands at a staggering speed. Like the aftermath of an explosion, the orange cloud engulfs the road and nearby buildings while it continues to move forward. Mohammed Mohsen captures the orange cloud getting thicker as it disperses and engulfs the road . The orange cloud gets thicker and drastically reduces visibility across the entire Arab state . Getting thicker, the cloud suddenly becomes darker and is it disperses further  sunlight becomes drastically reduced. A number of people stand alongside the video maker, staring in awe and filming the large cloud on their own camera phones. The video concludes with the filmmaker moving the camera around to show the sheer capacity of the cloud, which he is now very much encapsulated within. Mohammed Mohsen films the cloud above his head and captures the moment he becomes engulfed within it . Last week the storm filled Saudi Arabia’s air before spreading across the peninsula into the United Arab Emirates, Oman and Yemen. Despite sandstorms being a relatively common occurrence in this part of the world, they are not generally this big and rarely wreak so much havoc. Many people took to social media to upload the images they had taken of the sandstorm and share their experiences.",Citizen captured sandstorm sweeping its way through part of the state .

"Antarctica has experienced its highest temperature on record, according to meteorologists. Sensors at Argentina's Esperanza Base on the northern tip of the Antarctic Peninsula recorded a temperature of 17.5°C (63.5°F). According to meteorologists this is potentially a new record for the warmest temperature measured on the frozen continent. The new temperature record was measured on the northern tip of the Antarctic Peninsula (pictured) where the ice shelf covering the sea has declined considerably in recent years and glaciers are thought to be receding . Over a two day period last week temperatures reached 17.4°C (63.3°F) and 17.5°C (63.5°F). However, the heatwave on the coldest continent on Earth has still to be officially certified by the World Meteorological Organisation. Antarctica's icy edge is disappearing in warming ocean waters, with the last decade seeing the rate of ice loss increase dramatically. This is according to a new study that has combined 18-years worth of ice shelf thinning data from three different sets of satellites. The researchers claim that some ice shelves in West Antarctica have lost as much as 18 per cent of their volume in the last ten years. Satellite data from 1994 to . 2012 clearly shows the accelerating decline which could hasten the rise in global sea levels, . scientists say. The findings come amid concern among many scientists about the effects of . global climate change on Earth's vast, remote polar regions. The previous hottest temperature recorded in Antarctica - which is usually the coldest place on Earth - was in April 24 1961 when the temperature reached 17.1°C (62.8°F). Writing for website Weather Underground, meteorologist Dr Jeff Masters said: 'A new all-time temperature record for an entire continent is a rare event. 'This week's record temperatures were made possible by an unusually extreme jet stream contortion that brought a strong ridge of high pressure over the Antarctic Peninsula, allowing warm air from South America to push southwards over Antarctica. 'At the surface, west to east blowing winds over the Antarctic Peninsula rose up over the 1,000-foot high mountains just to the west of Esperanza Base, then descended and warmed via adiabatic compression (without transfer of heat) into a warm foehn wind (a warm dry wind that blows down a slope).' Antarctica is known as the coldest place on Earth where temperatures have dropped to -93.2°C (-135.8°F) on the East Antarctic Plateau. The graphic above shows rates of thickness change around the Antarctic coastline with areas of most loss in the past 18 years indicated by red circles and areas where ice has increased shown by blue circles . However, the Antarctic Peninsula is one of the fastest warming spots on Earth. While most of the continent has experienced an increase in ice sheet mass, nearly 10,000 square miles of ice has been lost from the ice shelves off coast of the Peninsula. Glaciers extending out from the fjords of the Antarctic Peninsula have also been retreating, according to researchers. Climate scientists have blamed the changes happening there on human-generated global warming. The collapse of the Larson B shelf (shown above) on the Antarctic Peninsula is one example of the changes that have been taking place on the continent in recent years and have caused concern among some scientists . Marine sediment cores suggest the changes happening in the area are unprecedented at least in the past 10,000 years. Dr Masters said last week's heatwave matched a trend occurring around the world. He said that in 2015 five nations or territories have now set all time records or matched their records for hottest temperatures in history. He added that 46 nations or territories, out of 235, have set or tied all time heat records since 2010. However, despite the new record temperature, climate scientists are urging caution about drawing conclusions from it. This graphic shows how warm water from the ocean may be increasing the flow of glaciers from the Antarctic ice sheet as they cause melting from below while fresh snow accumulates on top of the ice sheet . Gavin Schmidt, a climate scientist with Nasa's Goddard Institute for Space Studies in New York, told National Geographic that last year Antarctica also logged a record cold temperature. He said that long term climate changes in Antarctica are complex and still have not been complained properly. The new record will also depend on what scientists regard as being Antarctica. Currently the World Meteorological Society records the warmest temperature on the continent as being at Vanda Station on the opposite side Antarctica on 1 May 1974 when temperatures reached 15°C (59°F).",Temperatures at Esperanza Base on Antarctic Peninsula reached 63.5°F .

"Modern humans have been blamed for killing off the Neanderthals by out competing them, breeding with them and even outright murdering them. But new research suggests it may actually have been infectious diseases carried by our modern ancestors as they migrated out of Africa that finished them off. Scientists studying the latest genetic, fossil and archaeological evidence claim that Neanderthals suffered from a wide range of diseases that still plague us today. Scroll down for video . Neanderthals, like the reconstruction above on display at the Natural History Museum in London, may have succumbed to infectious diseases carried to Europe by modern humans as they migrated out of Africa . They have found evidence that suggests our prehistoric cousins would have been infected by diseases such as tuberculosis, typhoid, whooping cough, encephalitis and the common cold. But anthropologists from Cambridge University and Oxford Brookes University say that new diseases carried by modern humans may have led to the downfall of Neanderthals. It has been around 30,000 years since the ancestors of modern-day humans are thought to have wiped out the ancient Neanderthals. But the extinct species could be taking revenge on us from beyond the grave by making us more vulnerable to potentially killer diseases such as cancer and diabetes. Neanderthals and modern humans are thought to have co-existed for thousands of years and interbred, meaning Europeans now have roughly two per cent Neanderthal DNA. These 'legacy' genes have been linked to an increased risk from cancer and diabetes by new studies looking at our evolutionary history. However, some genes we inherited could have also improved our immunity to other diseases. Scientists have found that part of our HLA system, which helps white blood cells to identify and destroy foreign material in the body, could have come from Neanderthals. Other researchers have suggested that humans outside Africa are more vulnerable to Type 2 Diabetes because they interbred with Neanderthals. Researchers from Oxford and Plymouth universities have also found that genes thought to be risk factors in cancer were present in the Neanderthal genome. A gene that can cause diabetes in Latin Americans is also thought to have come from Neanderthals, long before their ancestors colonised the New World. Another recent genetic study by scientists at the University at Buffalo has suggested that Neanderthals may have suffered from psoriasis and Crohn's disease, a condition that affects the digestive system. They speculate that pathogens like Heliocbacter pylori, the bacteria that causes stomach ulcers, were brought to Europe by modern humans from Africa and may have infected Neanderthals, who would have been unable to fight off these new diseases. However, Neandethals may have also helped modern humans by passing on slivers of immunity against some diseases to our ancestors when they interbred. Dr Simon Underdown, a principal lecturer in anthropology at Oxford Brookes University and co-author of the study, said: 'As Neanderthal populations became more isolated they developed very small gene pools and this would have impacted their ability to fight off disease. 'When Homo sapiens came out of Africa they brought diseases with them. 'We know that Neanderthals were actually much more advanced than they have been given credit for and we even interbred with them. 'Perhaps the only difference was that we were able to cope with these diseases but Neanderthals could not.' The findings add to a growing body of evidence that Neanderthals were not as different from modern humans as was originally thought. Recent discoveries have suggested that rather than being brutish cavemen, Neanderthals had sophisticated culture, were master tool makers and may even have had their own language. The new study suggests that Neanderthals also suffered from many of the same afflictions and complaints that modern humans experience. Indeed, there is some evidence from caves that early humans may have burned their bedding in a bid to rid themselves of infestations of lice or bed bugs. Dr Underdown and his colleague Dr Charlotte Houldcroft, a researcher in infectious diseases at Cambridge University and University College London, analysed recent genetic studies on Neanderthals and other early humans. They also examined recent genetic research on common human pathogens that have aimed to trace their origins and combined it with fossil and archaeological evidence. Infectious bacteria like those that cause tuberculosis, shown above, may have been common in Neanderthals . Most evidence from the fossil record suggest that Neanderthals tended to suffer traumatic injuries as a result of their hunter gatherer lifestyle, but there are also signs of inflammation and infection. Their study, which is published on the open source database bioRxiv, contradicts the common view that infectious diseases only really became a problem for humans in the Holocene about 11,000 years ago when humans began living in dense settlements and farming livestock. Instead, they say many of the diseases we see around us today were common during the pleistocene when Neanderthals dominated much of Europe and Asia between 250,000 and 45,000 years ago, when they disappeared. Neanderthals are thought to have numbered up to 70,000 at their peak and lived in hunter gatherer societies . They say pathogens like TB, typhoid and Crimean fever that were thought to be zoonoses caught from herd animals may have actually originated in humans and were only passed to animals during the rise of farming around 8,000 years ago. Genetic sequencing of Neanderthal and Denisovan - another early human ancestor - DNA has shown that modern humans have inherited a number of genes from these extinct species. These include genes that provide immunity to viral infections such as tick-borne encephalitis. Dr Underdown said this virus would probably have been common in the forested areas of northern Europe that Neanderthals inhabited and so immunity would have been an advantage. Other genes found in modern Papua New Guineans that are involved in the immune response against viruses like dengue and influenza may have come from Neanderthals. The fossilised remains of Neanderthals, like the skull above, are revealing more details about their lifestyles . Analysis of ancient DNA has also shown that Neanderthals carried genes that would have protected them against bacterial blood poisoning, or sepsis. Dr Underdown said: 'There are genetic signals in the Neanderthal genome that suggest quite clearly that they were exposed to these types of diseases but also developed some resistance to them. 'It had been thought that many of these diseases began infecting humans with the population increases that came with domestication of animals and permanent settlements. 'Be here we have got Neanderthals being infected by these diseases long before those developments.'",Anthropologists claim that Neanderthals suffered many modern diseases . DNA analysis has shown that they had immunity against common illnesses . But they believe modern humans brought new infectious pathogens such as Heliocbacter pylori with them out of Africa and infected Neanderthals . This suggests infectious diseases are much older than previously thought .,a7e45ca775ee58a3a29b1a9f571beabc72e8d960
"Travelling can be tiring, especially if there are many flights involved and jet lag. However for one sleepy explorer, a trip of a lifetime to witness the Amazon Rainforest seemed to be all too much - that or he was completely uninterested in the adventurous trips he was booked on. Redditor Roxambops, aka Roxy de la Rosa posted the pictures of dozing Alex Elenes on the social networking site this week with the caption: ‘Went to the Amazon, cousin slept everywhere.’ Meet Alex Elenes. The traveller went on a trip of a lifetime to see the Amazon rainforest...but he missed the whole thing being asleep! Dozing away! Even a  trip piranha fishing could not stir the slumberer from his nap . Incredible nature moments the traveller missed due to napping include a pink dolphin watching tour and even a nail-biting piranha fishing expedition. Sadly he even missed seeing adorable sloths and monkeys in the wild, and impressive giant Amazon lily pads. When action was required of him, and he was due to take an intrepid jungle hike, naturally he slept through his alarm and missed the whole thing. The pictures were captured by his cousin Roxy de la Rosa who posted them on Reddit . Cousin Roxy said that her slumbering companion had been the one to push for the trip and that he chose the trip over going to Machu Picchu since he was set on seeing the jungle. The bemused San Diego said: ‘He had no real reason to keep falling asleep; he also slept any time we we were in our room. ‘Our trip was to Iquitos, Peru, for a few days at the end of February, and cost around £1,000 ($1,600) just for the Amazon addition.’ The sleeper had pushed for the trip, and said he was keen to see the Amazon rainforest in particular as he had already been to Machu Picchu, the alternative trip . Alex is said to be bemused at his new found internet fame, following the pictures going viral on the site. Roxy said: ‘He’s surprised anyone else thinks it’s funny besides us. ‘My favourite thing is that his biggest fear is falling out of a moving car while sleeping, yet he was fine napping on a tiny boat in the giant Amazon river.’ Expensive sleep! The trip cost Alex upwards of £1,000 ($1,600) and he even missed getting up for the jungle trek completely .","Alex Elenes persuaded his cousin to go to the Amazon over Machu Picchu .

"A mother-of-four whose addiction to Red Bull saw her drinking 24 cans of a day claims she has been cured of her habit by hypnosis. Sarah Weatherill, 31, became so dependent on the energy drink she was told if she cut down too quickly she could suffer a seizure as her body was so used to the caffeine. The law student spent a staggering £5,460 every year on the popular energy drink  since she became hooked in 2009. Scroll down for video . Sarah Weatherill, 31, was so addicted to Red Bull she drank 24 cans a day leaving her lethargic, depressed, suffering heart palpitations and constantly anxious . Her habit was at its worst the following year when she was studying for a law degree and wanted to stay awake to revise for exams. She soon became dependent on the drink and couldn't get out of bed unless she knew she had some in the fridge. She also became lethargic, depressed, had heart palpitations and was constantly feeling anxious as her £105-a-week habit spiralled out of control. She finally decided to do something about the problem after she realised the constant need for the Red Bull was severely damaging her health. And after seeing hypnotherapist earlier this month, she claims she has been cured of her addiction thanks to just one 50-minute session. Her habit had been so dangerous she needed to cut down to eight cans a day in the run up to the hypnosis - as coming off so much caffeine abruptly could have caused a seizure. A 250ml can of Red Bull contains: . 80mg of caffeine - the same amount as in an espresso. 27.5g sucrose and glucose combined - the equivalent of almost seven teaspoons of sugar. 10g Taurine (an amino acid that is thought to boost athletic performance). B vitamins. Ms Weatherill's 24-a-day habit meant she was drinking 1.92g of caffeine every day. A 2005 study into caffeine-related deaths said a person would need to ingest 5g to overdose, suggesting she was taking nearly half the potentially lethal dose. Ms Weatherill, from Coventry, said: 'I was studying for a Higher National Certificate in law in 2005 and used to have the odd Red Bull for a pick me up. 'It is hard to say when it became every day but I remember that by 2009 I was definitely hooked. 'Whenever I felt tired having a Red Bull would be the first thing I would do. 'It was  worst in 2010 when I was doing law exams at university and my children were off school. 'Sometimes I would have exams day after day - and with the stress of revising I was having 24 cans a day. 'I was pulling all-nighters and using the drinks to stay awake. In the end, it got to the point where I just needed Red Bull to function. 'I used to get my shopping delivered and used to have four or five crates and that only lasted for a week - it got out of hand. 'There would be times when I would get palpitations and shakes but I think I just got used to the caffeine.' Red Bull - whose slogan says the drink 'gives you wings' - is made by an Austrian company and is the highest selling energy drink in the world. Miss Weatherill claims she was cured of her addiction in one 50 minutes hypnotherapy session with David Kilmurry (pictured right) This table shows a range of drinks in order of caffeine content and their relation to daily allowances. Ms Weatherill was drinking 1.92g of caffeine every day, way above the recommended limit of 400 mg . The drink has been branded safe by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) and more than five billion cans were sold in 2013. However, it has been criticised for its high caffeine levels with one 250ml can containing 80mg, similar to one cup of coffee. Ms Weatherill's 24-a-day habit meant she was drinking 1.92g of the drug every day. A 2005 study into caffeine-related deaths said a person would need to ingest 5g to overdose, suggesting she was taking nearly half of a lethal dose. But, incredibly, she claims she was completely cured of her addiction after a single session with cognitive behavioral hypnotherapist David Kilmurry on April 11. Ms Weatherill, who lives with boyfriend Phil Evans, 27, and four children aged between three and 14, added: 'I knew at the start of this year it was a dependency so thought I would give hypnotherapy a go. 'It was a weird process, I felt like I was in there for 15 minutes but it was 50 minutes. 'All I can remember is that it was like a kaleidoscope effect, I remember him saying I didn't need Red Bull.' 'I am convinced I won't have another can. I feel like a different person,' Ms Weatherill said after undergoing hypnotherapy to cure her of her energy drink habit . She added: 'It was like a paralysis because I had an itch, but couldn't move to scratch it. 'It gave me a lot of strength because in the past I have tried to give up but lasted a week and then gone back to the Red Bull. 'I am convinced I won't have another can. I feel like a different person.' Hypnotherapist Mr Kilmurry added: 'Sarah's addiction was very serious. 'Coming off that amount of caffeine and taurine  can lead to seizures, so she gradually reduced her intake before coming to me to make a safe escape. 'Energy drink addicts can also suffer insomnia, depression, anxiety and heart palpitations. 'Luckily Sarah soldiered through and has been amazed at the changes.'","Sarah Weatherill, 31, spent £5, 460 every year on the popular energy drink .

"A mum is outraged after she claims her son was turned away from a Qantas flight due to his autism. Gizelle Laurente had booked her son, Jacob Prien, on a flight from Darwin to Brisbane yesterday, so he could spend Easter with his father and younger brother. However, Ms Laurente feared Jacob's dreams had been shattered, when she was told her son would not be able to fly with the airline's unaccompanied minors service. Gizelle Laurente said her son, Jacob, was not allowed to board a flight from Darwin to Brisbane because of his autism . Gizelle Laurente, couldn't afford to fly with him, said the captain of the flight came to meet Jacob at the boarding gate, according to the NT News. Ms Laurente said she then told the captain her son had been given a higher dose of his usual medication, which a doctor told her would help ensure he was calm throughout the flight. She also had a letter from her son's paediatrician, but Jacob was not allowed to board the flight. When asked by a friend what sparked the outburst, she replied: 'Discriminated Jake. Wouldnt let him onboard because hes Autistic/Adhd. He had already taken his Ritalin which he is not required to take out of school hours or on weekends or on holidays. Its more for concentration. But administered it to make them Qantas happy but still not good enough. Cruel. So cruel.' Jacob was booked to fly to Brisbane so he could spend the Easter Weekend with his father and younger brother . Qantas said he was not able to fly because it had not been given the required paperwork to clear an unaccompanied child . 'The pilot told me unless you buy a ticket and travel with your son he won't be flying,' she said. 'I explained that I couldn't afford a ticket and he said 'well I'm sorry your son can't board'. 'I was heartbroken for him, I just started crying.' Ms Laurente later attacked the airline on her Facebook page, where she said it 'can suck a big fat one'. 'The pilot told me unless you buy a ticket and travel with your son he won't be flying,' Ms Laurente said . However, Qantas said it had not in any way discriminated against Ms Laurente and her son, and said Jacob was not allowed on the flight because he had not been cleared by their medical team. 'The health and safety of our passengers is our foremost concern at all times,' a spokeswoman said in a statement. 'The crew sought professional medical advice and took the decision not to allow travel until further information about the condition could be gathered to make sure there was no risk to the passenger,' Qantas said . Jacob was given the all-clear by Qantas, and on Friday morning he flew to Brisbane for the weekend . 'In this case, the crew sought professional medical advice and took the decision not to allow travel until further information about the condition could be gathered to make sure there was no risk to the passenger. 'The crew had the passenger's best interests in mind and there was absolutely no intention to cause distress or discriminate in any way.' Standard procedure for such flights is that medical documents, such as those presented by Ms Laurente, would be given to Qantas a few days in advance of the trip or when tickets are bought. Jacob was given the all-clear to travel today, and made it to Brisbane in time to spend the Easter Weekend with his dad.","Mum says her son was banned from Qantas flight due to his autism .

"Two months after it announced it was launching its own mobile network, Google is now looking at ways to get rid of roaming fees. The tech giant is said to be in talks with Hutchison Whampoa, the owner of the Three network, to let its users make calls and send texts in any country at no extra cost. Industry sources said the firms are discussing a 'wholesale access agreement' that would help Google create a global network. Scroll down for video . Google is said to be in talks with Hutchison Whampoa, the owner of the Three network, to let its users make calls and send texts in any country at no extra cost. Industry sources said the firms are discussing a 'wholesale access agreement' that would help Google create a global network . Customers would then be able to use this global network to make calls, send texts and use data as part of their plan, regardless of where in the world they are. In particular, a deal with Hutchison would extend the service to the UK, Ireland, Italy and Spain., but the plans would only affect the small base of customers on Google's plan. Last week Three extending its Feel at Home scheme to Spain and New Zealand. Feel at Home lets Three customers use their phones, and their plans, in the same way they can at home even when they're in a foreign country. Spain and New Zealand take the total number of Feel at Home countries to 18. The other nations include France, Switzerland, Israel, Norway, Sri Lanka, Australia, Finland, Indonesia, Macau, Italy, Austria, Hong Kong, Sweden, Denmark, the Republic of Ireland and the USA. Three already offers a similar scheme called Feel at Home that lets customers use their phones and their plans in 18  countries. Google's vice president Sundar Pichai confirmed rumours his firm was launching a mobile network plan during during a talk at Mobile World Congress in Barcelona in February. It will be initially offered to cities that have Google Fiber, such as Kansas, Texas and Utah and Google is working with network operators on developing the cellular plan. ‘You will see us announce it in the coming months, I think we are at a stage where it is important to think about hardware, software and connectability together,’ said the 43-year-old. The rumours of a Google mobile network plan first emerged in April last year. Instead of building masts, Google will buy access to existing 3G and 4G networks at wholesale prices and sell the connectivity back to customers at a cheaper rate. Three already offers a similar scheme called Feel at Home (pictured) that lets customers use their phones and their plans for free, in 18 countries. Spain and New Zealand were the latest countries to join this scheme . A mobile virtual network operator (MVNO) is a company that offers mobile service plans using existing networks. MVNOs don't own the infrastructure the networks are built on. Instead, they buy access to parts of these networks at wholesale prices. The company can then use this access to run its own wireless plans and resell the connectivity back to customers - usually at a reduced rate. Lycamobile in the U.S, for example, is an MVNO because it runs on T-Mobile’s network. In the UK, Tesco Mobile shares O2’s, and ultimately Telefonica’s, networks. An MVNO is typically run as an independent company, with its own staff and customer service . This would make Google a mobile virtual network operator (MVNO) similar to Lycamobile in the US that runs on T-Mobile’s network, and Tesco Mobile in the UK which shares O2’s networks. MVNOs don't own the infrastructure the networks are built on. Instead, they buy access to parts of these networks at wholesale prices. The company can then use these network to run its own wireless plans and resell the connectivity back to customers - usually at a reduced rate. Mr Pinchai said: ‘We want to be able to experiment along those lines, [but] we don't intend to be a network operator at scale.’ He described the plans as a ‘project’ and will do it on a small enough scale to not threaten existing networks. In particular, Mr Pichai said the setup should provide at seamless connection between Wi-Fi and mobile networks. Sources said at the time of the original rumours that any Google-branded mobile network would initially launch in cities that have Google Fiber.

Travelex has launched a 'Supercard' that makes fees charged by banks for using your card abroad a thing of the past. Based on an average 10-day holiday, Travelex told MailOnline a family of four could save almost £110. The Supercard looks and works like a standard debit card, but it connects to an app and lets users consolidate multiple cards onto one account. The banking fees are paid for by Travelex and savings are shown in real-time. And if a card is lost or stolen it can be blocked using the app. In 2013, the firm announced it was expanding the service to Austin in Texas, Provo in Utah and a number of other towns in Missouri and California. More locations are due to be added later this year, but the roll-out is slow because Google has to install the relevant infrastructure needed. Google Fiber starts at $70 (£42) a month and has been praised for offering high speeds at relatively low prices. Google’s wireless plans would remove some of the costs, and time spent, in setting up its own network and it would equally benefit from using already established and well-connected networks. This could help Google cement itself as an internet service provider. Google could additionally use the network to sell its Nexus range of phones, for example, with contract or service plans.","Google is said to be in talks with Hutchison Whampoa, which owns Three .

"The finish might have been uncharacteristically scruffy, scored after his first shot came back off the keeper, but it was a landmark goal for Lionel Messi at the Nou Camp on Saturday as he made it 400 goals for Barcelona in a 2-0 win over Valencia. Messi scored with the last kick and Luis Suarez scored with practically his first, putting Barcelona 1-0 up after just 56 seconds. Between the two strikes Claudio Bravo saved a Dani Parejo penalty as Valencia dominated the first half but they couldn't make their pressure tell. For Messi, still only 27, it was another milestone. 'I hope to score many more,' he wrote on his Facebook page. Lionel Messi (left), Luis Suarez (centre) and Neymar celebrate Suarez's goal in the first minute for Barcelona against Valencia . Suarez (left) lashed the ball in after neat play from Messi to continue his fine form for Barcelona . Valencia enjoyed a better first half, despite the scoreline and captain Dani Parejo missed a penalty in the ninth minute . Bravo celebrates his penalty save but Barcelona were fortunate to take a lead into half time . Messi tapped in Barcelona's second goal in stoppage time to seal the victory over Valencia . The Argentine has reached the 400 goal total in just 471 games with 309 goals in the league, 75 in the Champions League and 32 in the Copa del Rey. Goals in the World Club Cup and the Spanish and European Super Cup have also made up the stratospheric total. He also has 141 assists to his name in those 471 matches. Afterwards Luis Enrique said: ‘Messi gave us what he always gives us. But it’s not just about him it’s about the whole forward line and the whole team.’ Suarez was once again decisive after his two goals in midweek against PSG in the Champions League and he is now just six games from picking up a league winners medal in his first season. The early strike would have counted for nothing however if Valencia had made their first-half domination pay and had Bravo not stopped that eighth-minute penalty. As Messi raced from inside his own half to get the late late second, Enrique could be seen jumping up and down in the technical area long before the ball was in the back of the net. He knows what a major hurdle his side have now cleared. The victory sees Luis Enrique's side move five points away from Real Madrid, who take on Malaga later on Saturday . Messi skips past two Valencia challenges as Barcelona secured an important win against La Liga's fourth placed side . Messi attempts an acrobatic kick for Barcelona against Valencia in the La Liga encounter at the Nou Camp on Saturday . Barcelona were ahead inside the first minute with a move that swept from one end of the pitch to the other starting with Bravo releasing the ball quickly and finishing with a first time finish from Suarez past Diego Alves into far corner. Between the two Barca moved the ball quickly with Sergi Busquets releasing Messi and his pass poked home by the Uruguayan who has now scored 12 goals in his last 12 games. Far from being shell-shocked by the early set-back Valencia unleashed the big guns and Barcelona were under-fire for the rest of the first half. Paco Alcacer and Rodrigo both went close and were running an out-of-sorts Gerard Pique ragged. On eight minutes Valencia should have equalized. Rodrigo went down easily under a half challenge from Pique. It was a generous spot-kick and Bravo got down well to Parejo’s kick to save it. With a full Camp Nou sensing that a win here would be a huge step towards the title for Barcelona, and Valencia in a scrap of their own to finish in the top four the game was being played at cup final pace. Parejo flattened Busquets who for once he didn't need to exaggerate the fall as he crashed to ground. And full-back Orban risked a first half sending off with foul after foul. He was shown a yellow and never appeared for the second period. Adding to the drama was the panic in Barcelona’s defence. Pique was either failing to stay on his feet or giving the ball to Valencia forwards. The falling down was contagious with Adriano – another who didn’t come out for the second half – also losing his footing despite the perfect playing conditions. Neymar (right) attempts a diving header for Barcelona as his side looked to increase their lead at the top of La Liga . Barcelona have a five-point lead over Madrid, who could cut the deficit to two points with victory over Malaga . Alcacer continued to threaten. It’s not difficult to see why on-loan Manchester City forward Alvaro Negredo, who Valencia are obliged to buy this summer, cannot get a game at the moment. It is also why many Spain supporters think Diego Costa should not be Vicente Del Bosque’s first choice. Alcacer led the line and with Sofiane Feghouli and Rodrigo buzzing around him. Valencia gave Barcelona more problems than any visiting side at the Nou Camp this season. Alcacer came the closest in what remained of the first half making room for a shot from the edge of the area and hitting the base of Bravo’s post but Barca remained a threat on the break. In their best move Messi and Suarez linked with Neymar who pulled the ball back to Xavi instead of finishing. The midfielder set-up Messi and his shot flashed wide. Games at the Nou Camp can be like bull fights that used to be held in Catalonia before they were banned. Everyone in the arena knows the bull loses, it’s just a matter of when. But Valencia had worn the horns in the first half and Barcelona were relieved to get down the tunnel at half time still in one piece and still 1-0 up. The second half brought more calm to a Barcelona defence that now had Mascherano back alongside Pique after his first half spent in midfield. Valencia carried less threat and Barca went close with Neymar heading wide and Messi hitting the bar with a free-kick. He won a the kick with a brilliant run away from Parejo who up-ended him and his effort beat Diego Alves but not the frame of the goal. With 25 minutes left he moved to centre-forward as Suarez was taken off. There was no Neymar style sulk as he made his way off to a thunderous reception from the home fans. He goes into Tuesday’s game against PSG looking for his 20th goal of what has been an excellent first season. Negredo replaced Alcacer and immediately Valencia had their best chance of the second half with Bravo palming away Rodrigo’s shot. But there was to be no reward for all their fire and invention and when Messi raced clear to score the second with the last kick of the game it was all over in every sense.",Luis Suarez scored Barcelona's opening goal against Valencia in the first minute of the game .

"Whistleblower Chelsea Manning has given in an in-depth interview from behind bars in Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, describing the 'painful and awkward' process and conditions of transitioning to a woman from inside a military prison. Born Bradley Manning, the 27-year-old former intelligence analyst was convicted of espionage in July 2013 for sending a trove of classified documents to the WikiLeaks website and was subsequently sentenced to 35 years prison. One month after being found guilty, Manning announced that he had always identified as female and planned to start living as a woman named Chelsea Elizabeth Manning, officially switching names in April 2014. In February this year, after suing the Defense Department, Manning was approved for hormone treatment, allowing the former Army private to make the transition into a woman while serving out her sentence. Speaking: Chelsea Manning, 27, the soldier convicted of leaking a trove of secret documents and sentenced to 35 year prison, has given her first in-depth interview since announcing plans to transition into a woman . Manning, a former army private who enlisted as Bradley, has had her name officially changed to Chelsea and recently received approval to undergo hormone therapy for gender reassignment while in prison . She was also permitted to have some amenities, including makeup and underwear, but is not allowed to grow her hair long, which she sees as a major affliction. Just this month, Manning started Tweeting and interacting with supporters online from prison. There is no internet access, making it a complicated process that involves her dictating messages over the telephone. Now, Manning has done an interview for the May edition ofCosmopolitan, which was conducted through written letters back and forth. Manning said not being able to grow her hair is 'painful and awkward', because she is forced to reject one of the biggest physical transformations her body will go through now she is taking hormones. 'I am torn up,' she told the magazine. Revelations: In the new interview, Manning speaks of a tumultuous childhood, why she enlisted in the military, and realizing she was a woman trapped in a man's body . 'I get through each day OK, but at night, when I'm alone in my room, I finally burn out and crash.' Manning grew up with a dysfunction home life in Oklahoma, and that combined with bullying at school made him retreat into denial. He found solace by sneaking into his older sister's room and trying on her clothes makeup. She had a mirror that allowed you to see yourself under different lighting, which Manning found fascinating. Manning was constantly being called 'girly boy' and 'faggy' at school, however his father would tell him to 'man up' in the face of such comments. This caused Manning to get into a lot of fights at school, she says. After her mother attempted suicide and her marriage to Manning's father brokedown, she moved with her mother to Wales. Of attending high school in overseas, Manning recalled: 'I don't think I ever said ""I'm gay"" or ""I'm trans."" It was more like, ""Is it normal for guys to crossdress a lot?""' Projection: Manning recently started a Twitter account operated using the telephone from prison, and this is her profile photo, which is believed to be an impression of what she will look like as a woman . Former life: Manning,had already secured permission last year to be known under the name 'Chelsea' instead of 'Bradley' Manning returning to Oklahoma after graduating and moved back in with her father, starting an internship as a software programmer and designer. However a falling out with her father lead to a period of homelessness. She lived out of her car in Chicago for a while until moving in with an aunt in Washington D.C. There she attended Montgomery College and worked two sales jobs to pay for her tuition. She was growing more and more to understand her transgender self, and wanted to seek therapy, but could not afford it. On top of studying and working so much, she was falling apart with stress. 'It was all exhausting me to the point I was turning to soda, cigarettes, and the Internet for an escape,' she told Cosmopolitan. Suddenly, enlisting in the military seemed like a good alternative, and her father supported the move. Despite a troubling experience in training, where Manning received school-like bullying and torment, she went  to become an Army intelligence analyst in New York and prepared to deploy to Iraq. There she started a relationship with a student at Brandeis University. 'I fell in love with him,' Manning told the magazine. 'He was not my first relationship, but he was certainly the most serious one. It was the first time Manning spoke to someone about wanting to become a woman. While the relationship fell apart once Manning got to Iraq, his understanding of self only intensified. The experience 'made me absolutely certain of who I am,' Manning said. 'Dealing with reams and reams of emails, memos, and reports of people dying around me every day — to the point it becomes just a statistic to many people — made me realize just how short and precious our lives really are. 'I could've been killed at any moment too. We all can, really. 'So what better day to start being ourselves than today, right? Yeah, it sounds tacky, but it's absolutely true. 'When I went on leave in January 2010, I was comfortable dressing as a woman in public. 'I wouldn't have been able to do that before I deployed to a combat zone.' Prison: Manning is serving out a 35-year sentence at Fort Leavenworth for violating the Espionage Act . Manning refused to be drawn on leaking documents, which occurred a little after this time. The former army intelligence analyst was convicted in August 2013 of espionage and other offenses after admitting to handing over more than 700,000 classified documents, including military intelligence reports and State Department cables, to the anti-secrecy website WikiLeaks. US officials describe Manning's document dump as the biggest leak of classified files in American history. She could be eligible for parole in about seven years, however may have to answer to an army parole for the duration of her 35 year sentence.","Chelsea Manning gave an interview to Cosmopolitan from Fort Leavenworth prison in Kansas, serving 35 years for violating the Espionage Act . After being convicted in July 2013 as Bradley Manning, she admitted having gender dysphoria and announced plans to transition into a woman .

"With tears in her eyes, a grandmother bends down and embraces the seven-year-old granddaughter she has not seen in years. In another scene, a man smiles blissfully as he hugs his emotional father. These pictures show the moving moments men, women and children living in the United States were reunited with their deported relatives after the border gate to Mexico was temporarily opened on Sunday. The steel gate at Border Field State Park in California, which was put in place in the mid-1990s, was unlocked by officials in honor of Children's Day, a Mexican holiday that celebrates youngsters and family. And for selected families, it was a long-awaited, intense experience. Two young boys reportedly fell to their knees as they crossed into Mexico and saw their cherished mother for the first time in two years. Emotional: With tears in her eyes, Yolanda Verona, from Tijuana, Mexico, bends down and embraces her seven-year-old granddaughter, Frida Villagomez - whom she has not seen in years - after the gate at Border Field State Park in California was briefly opened for Children's Day . Reunited: Robert Vivar (pictured in the light-colored top) watches as his daughter, Lelainah, seven, hugs his father Robert Vivar Sr at the gate . Joyful: Mr Vivar smiles blissfully as he embraced by his emotional father on the other side of the California fence, while his daughters Lelainah and four-year-old Willow watch. A Border Patrol Officer (left) also smiles as the family reunites during the event, organized by Border Angels . Tear-jerking: Lourdes Barraza Torres and her toddler daughter, Reyna, are seen hugging Torres's two sons, including Alexis Lopez, 10, as they are reunited for the first time in two years. Alex said he 'felt nervous, but at the same time, excited' at the prospect of seeing his mother again . However, the pair, whose mother had been deported to the country while they were at school, only had two minutes to spend with her - because then it was time for another family to be reunited. One of the boys, Alexis Lopez, now 10, told U-T San Diego that he 'felt nervous, but at the same time, excited' to briefly meet his mother, Lourdes Barraza, in front of other families and photographers. He added: 'We talked about how life was without our mom. About how much we love each other.' Event organizer Father Dermot Rodgers said that while the brief reunions were held for Children's Day, they were also meant to draw attention to what he called a broken immigration system. Many of the families were separated when relatives were deported to Mexico after living in the U.S. without documentation. The gate had only been opened to those affected once before, in 2013. No touching: The gate at Border Field State Park, which was put in place in the mid-1990s, was unlocked by officials for Children's Day, a Mexican holiday that celebrates youngsters and family.

Beaming: Ms Florencia speaks with her relatives through the border fence, which has only been opened to relatives once before - in 2013 . Special event: Many of the families were separated when relatives were deported to Mexico after living in the U.S. without documentation . Aside from then and on Sunday, separated loved ones had only been able to speak to each other through the U.S./Mexico border fence, which has thick, steel mesh and is patrolled by officials. The mesh makes seeing each other nearly impossible - never mind touching. On Sunday, four families - some from as far away as Florida - were given the chance to hug, kiss and share tears of joy. Border Angels organized the event. Founded by Enrique Morones in 1986, the non-profit organization provided toys for children who were reunited with their relatives at the fence. 'It’s only a couple of minutes, but that’s a whole world to somebody who had only been able to see (their family) through Skype, or the wall,' Mr Morones told the news site on Monday. Couple: Hugo Alvarado, of San Diego, California, chats to his wife Guadalupe through the border fence, which is heavily patrolled by officials . Gazing out: Ms Florencia speaks with family members through the border fence. It is not known when the border gate will next be opened .

'It’s only a couple of minutes, but that’s a whole world to somebody who had only been able to see (their family) through Skype, or the wall,' Mr Morones said on Monday as the gate was opened to families . Tight security: Border Patrol Officers are pictured standing by the gate in the border fence, just minutes before four families were reunited . 'To finally put your arms around somebody and realize that love has no borders is very significant.' The pictures from Sunday's event include an image of two-year-old Abel speaking to his mother, Yolanda Verona through the border fence, while being held by his uncle, Albert Villagomez. They also include a photo of Marisela Augustin holding her two-year-old son Angel after traveling to the border with her husband, Maurilio, to see his mother, Antonia Florencia, who lives in Oaxaca.

"House leaders have reached a bipartisan compromise on a bill that would end the National Security Agency's controversial collection of American phone records, but the measure faces an uncertain future in the Senate. The House Judiciary Committee on Thursday overwhelmingly passed the latest version of a bill known as the USA Freedom Act by a bipartisan vote of 25 to 2. The measure seeks to codify President Barack Obama's proposal to end the NSA's collection of domestic calling records.  It would allow the agency to request certain records held by the telephone companies under a court order in terrorism investigations. The authority to collect those records and other related surveillance provisions of the Patriot Act will expire June 1 unless Congress passes a law reauthorizing it. The House bill would do that, with changes. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . UNHOLY TRIUMVIRATE? CIA Director John Brennan (center), National Security Agency Director Mike Rogers (right) and Director of National Intelligence James Clapper (left) will soon be handed new rules of the road for mass-surveillance efforts . REMEMBER ME? NSA leaker Edward Snowden is still taking refuge outside the US, nearly two years after exposing the depth of the agency's eavesdropping program . Republican Representatives Bob Goodlatte and Jim . Sensenbrenner, and Democrats John Conyers and Jerry Nadler . introduced the 'USA Freedom Act.' It would result in phone companies, not the NSA, collecting so-called 'metadata' on trillions of phone calls. Government agencies could get access to it by applying to a judge empowered by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. Similar legislation was introduced in the U.S. Senate by . Democrat Patrick Leahy and Republican Mike Lee. But Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch . McConnell is seemingly out of phase, sponsoring his own bill to extend the PATRIOT Act – unchanged – until the end of 2020. McConnell said he intended his bill to be a starting point for legislative debate, not a complete solution. A similar bill to the one that cleared the Judiciary Committee passed the full House last year by a bipartisan vote of 303 to 121 but narrowly failed a procedural vote in the Senate. The Judiciary Committee chairman, Virginia Republican Rep.  Bob Goodlatte, said the bill's provisions had been carefully negotiated with both the intelligence committee and intelligence agencies. During the hearing, lawmakers said a deal had been reached to bring the USA Freedom Act to the floor without going through the intelligence committee, where many Republicans support continuing the NSA bulk collection. The NSA's collection and storage of U.S. 'to and from' landline calling records – times, dates and numbers, but not content of the calls – was the most controversial program among many disclosed by former NSA systems administrator Edward Snowden. CONTRARIAN: Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Kentucky Republican, is trying to reauthorize the USA PATRIOT Act without changes . Some NSA officials opposed the program, and independent evaluations have found it of limited value as a counterterrorism tool. Goodlatte said the House bill would create a 'narrower, targeted program,' that will still allow the NSA to hunt for connections between foreign terrorists and U.S. residents. 'We must act decisively to end bulk collection in the United States,' said Rep. John Conyers, the ranking Democrat, in an Associated Press interview. 'For years, the NSA has collected our phone records, yet it cannot point to a single attack that the collection has stopped,' added Rep. James Sensenbrenner, a Wisconsin Republican who was one of the Patriot Act's original authors. Some lawmakers offered amendments they said would toughen the bill's civil liberties provisions, but those were voted down, with other lawmakers saying they would kill the deal and empower those who want to continue NSA phone records collection. A civil liberties group praised the bill. 'The USA Freedom Act of 2015 offers an effective path forward in reforming overbroad domestic surveillance and putting an end to the bulk collection of Americans' communications,' said Nuala O'Connor, president of the Center for Democracy and Technology, in a statement.",FREEDOM Act would replace PATRIOT Act when it expires on June 1 .

"A 17-year old who spontaneously decided to run off for four days survived during his disappearance by eating from the fruit trees at his high school. Connor Sullivan, of Cupertino, California, attended his first period class at Monta Vista High School on Monday morning before disappearing for roughly 80 hours. After the junior returned home on his own Thursday night, police who had been searching for him learned that the teenager had never left the Bay Area town and was using the water fountains and Porta Potty on campus. Though search parties took off from the school, they could not find Sullivan, who said after his return that he slept under the bleachers every night, police told Daily Mail Online. Police and volunteers had searched (left) frantically for Connor Sullivan, (right) 17, of Cupertino, California, though the teenager was hiding at and around his high school . Sullivan reportedly survived by eating from the fruit trees at Monta Vista High School, which grow pineapple guavas and pear-like quinces (file photo) Sergeant James Jensen said that the teenager spoke with police on Thursday night, and said that he had spent most of his time around the school and in the foothills to the west. He is thought to have sustained himself on fruit growing in Cupertino residents' yards, as well as that on trees at his school. The school, which is about ten minutes' drive from the headquarters of tech giant Apple, has rows of pineapple guava fruit trees native to South America, according to its student newspaper. It also has a tree that bears quinces, yellow fruits native to Turkey that look similar to pears. Both quinces and pineapple guavas, which are also called feijoas, can be eaten raw. Police and 250 volunteers had searched frantically for the 5'5'' 150lb boy, according to ABC 7.

In addition to school, the student also missed all of his practices. Police had searched for the teen, who does not have a car, at his school and in the surrounding neighborhood. Search parties had even gathered at the portable toilets he is thought to have used. Sullivan was reportedly stressed from school, though his family said that was not the reason he ran off and did not disclose the real cause. The teenager had originally agreed with police to do a press conference, though has now said that he will write a letter explaining his disappearance. Hundreds of volunteers gathered to look for the missing teenager, but could not find him even though he spent much of his time at and around the school .

"(CNN)Donald Sterling's racist remarks cost him an NBA team last year. But now it's his former female companion who has lost big. A Los Angeles judge has ordered V. Stiviano to pay back more than $2.6 million in gifts after Sterling's wife sued her. In the lawsuit, Rochelle ""Shelly"" Sterling accused Stiviano of targeting extremely wealthy older men. She claimed Donald Sterling used the couple's money to buy Stiviano a Ferrari, two Bentleys and a Range Rover, and that he helped her get a $1.8 million duplex. Who is V. Stiviano? Stiviano countered that there was nothing wrong with Donald Sterling giving her gifts and that she never took advantage of the former Los Angeles Clippers owner, who made much of his fortune in real estate. Shelly Sterling was thrilled with the court decision Tuesday, her lawyer told CNN affiliate KABC. ""This is a victory for the Sterling family in recovering the $2,630,000 that Donald lavished on a conniving mistress,"" attorney Pierce O'Donnell said in a statement. ""It also sets a precedent that the injured spouse can recover damages from the recipient of these ill-begotten gifts."" Stiviano's gifts from Donald Sterling didn't just include uber-expensive items like luxury cars. According to the Los Angeles Times, the list also includes a $391 Easter bunny costume, a $299 two-speed blender and a $12 lace thong. Donald Sterling's downfall came after an audio recording surfaced of the octogenarian arguing with Stiviano. In the tape, Sterling chastises Stiviano for posting pictures on social media of her posing with African-Americans, including basketball legend Magic Johnson. ""In your lousy f**ing Instagrams, you don't have to have yourself with -- walking with black people,"" Sterling said in the audio first posted by TMZ. He also tells Stiviano not to bring Johnson to Clippers games and not to post photos with the Hall of Famer so Sterling's friends can see. ""Admire him, bring him here, feed him, f**k him, but don't put (Magic) on an Instagram for the world to have to see so they have to call me,"" Sterling said. NBA Commissioner Adam Silver banned Sterling from the league, fined him $2.5 million and pushed through a charge to terminate all of his ownership rights in the franchise.

"Washington (CNN)Until recently, if you sat in church on Sunday mornings, pollsters could predict where you stood on same-sex marriage. What a difference a decade makes. In 2003, when the Massachusetts Supreme Court became the country's first to legalize same-sex marriage, less than 30% of religiously affiliated Americans supported gays' and lesbians' right to wed. By 2014, that number had climbed to 47%, according to a survey conducted by the Public Religion Research Institute. That's more than the 45% who said they opposed same-sex nuptials. The margin is small but statistically significant, said Robert P. Jones, CEO of PRRI, because of the exceptionally large pool of respondents: 40,000 adult Americans. (Eight percent refused to answer or said they didn't know their stance on same-sex marriage.) According to PRRI's poll, there are now more people of faith who favor marriage equality than stand against it, a dramatic turn in one of this country's most divisive debates and a generational shift with the potential to sweep through everything from the wedding industry to the 2016 presidential race. ""There's been a huge swing in the last decade,"" said Jones. ""There are now big, mainstream groups on both sides of the debate."" If the U.S. Supreme Court has been paying attention, it likely saw this trend coming. Each time the high court has considered a case related to same-sex marriage, the pile of amicus briefs from religious groups supporting gay rights has inched a little taller, and the crowds protesting outside their grand marble steps has gradually grown more diverse. On Tuesday, for example, as the Supreme Court hears oral arguments in Obergefell v. Hodges, a case widely expected to produce a landmark ruling on same-sex marriage, an interfaith coalition of clergy led by the dean of Washington's National Cathedral is planning to march in support of LGBT rights. ""I join with many across the spectrum of American faith communities in my hope that the Court's ruling will permit same-sex marriage in all 50 states,"" the Very Rev. Gary Hall, the cathedral's dean, said in a statement. ""I trust that their judgment will end discrimination against those who seek God's blessing on their marriages."" Clergy from Hall's religious denomination, the Episcopal Church, have also submitted an amicus brief in support of same-sex marriage. The brief is endorsed by nearly 2,000 faith leaders, including rabbis, Methodist ministers, Lutheran bishops, seminary professors and Congregationalist chaplains. Another brief, submitted by the Anti-Defamation League, is signed by Jewish, Hindu and Presbyterian groups. In a reverse of traditional arguments against gay marriage, some members of these groups say their religious rights will be curtailed if states do not allow them to perform same-sex nuptials. Prominent and powerful religious groups are lined up on the other side as well, including the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, National Association of Evangelicals, Southern Baptist Convention, Assemblies of God and the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, also known as the Mormon church. Together, leaders of these faiths represent more than 120 million Americans. But as PRRI's survey shows, there are often differences of opinion between the pulpits and the pews. Despite vocal opposition from the U.S. Catholic Bishops, for example, 60% of Catholics now favor same-sex marriage. That's a huge increase from 2003, when just 35% backed gay rights, according to survey conducted at the time by the Pew Research Center. Mainline Protestants -- so-called for their prominence in 20th century American life -- also saw a huge shift in the last decade. While 36% supported same-sex marriage in 2003, now 62% do. At a glance, the pro-gay marriage faction is now strikingly diverse, encompassing Buddhists, Catholics, Jews and Hindus. But the pro-traditional marriage crowd is just as motley, bridging black Protestants, Mormons, Muslims and white evangelicals, according to PRRI's survey. Same-sex marriage rights worldwide . Legalized nationwide:Argentina, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Iceland, Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Spain, South Africa, Sweden . Legalized in certain regions:Brazil, Mexico, United States . Civil unions or domestic partnerships:Andorra, Austria, Brazil, Colombia, Czech Republic, Ecuador, Finland, France, Germany, Greenland, Hungary, Ireland, Liechtenstein, Luxembourg, New Zealand, Slovenia, Switzerland, United Kingdom, Uruguay and parts of Australia, Mexico, United States and Venezuela . The survey data comes from PRRI's American Values Atlas, conducted between April and December of last year. PRRI is a nonpartisan, nonprofit research group that focuses on faith and American culture. Separate surveys conducted by PRRI and other groups show much of the newfound religious support for same-sex marriage is coming from younger Americans. Seven in 10 Millennials, for example, support same-sex marriage and say that faith groups alienate young adults by being judgemental on sexual ethics. Half of millennial Republicans say gays and lesbians should be allowed to marry, and 43% of white evangelical millennials agree. Those numbers could put GOP presidential candidates in a tight spot, said Jones, as they try to expand their base and appeal to younger Americans. ""The real challenge for GOP candidates is how can they plant their feet deftly enough not to offend older conservatives in the primaries but still be able to pivot in the general election to a younger generation,"" Jones said. Politicians may pivot on same-sex marriage, but Bible-believing Christians should not -- even if public opinion turns against them, said Denny Burk, a professor at Boyce College, a Southern Baptist school in Louisville, Kentucky. ""For me, the number of people who come to the message is not the main issue. There are periods when the Gospel is popular and periods when it's not. You can't base your evaluation of its truthfulness on its popularity at a given historical moment."" Still, Burk said he doesn't doubt that more millennials accept same-sex marriage, and he fully expects the Supreme Court to legalize gay weddings countrywide this June when the justices render a decision in Obergefell v. Hodges. But the fight is far from over, Burk said. ""Just like we've seen this decades-long culture war with abortion, we're going to see the same thing with gay marriage.""","There are now more people of faith who favor marriage equality than stand against it, according to a new poll . If the U.S. Supreme Court has been paying attention, it likely saw this trend coming .",057854bbbc888a8607afd8a699533efc14d34be6
"There is a rich and mildly amusing irony about Arsenal fans calling Chelsea boring for defending well, when these Gooners still celebrate a side that ground out results just to preserve their unbeaten record in 2003-04. They drew four of their last seven, the lifeless goalless stalemate at home to Birmingham a particular highlight. Instead of giving a shallow critique fuelled by sour grapes on Chelsea's title winners, maybe those fans should focus on the shortcomings of their own players, and in particular Mesut Ozil. Mesut Ozil has been sublime in recent weeks but he didn't do enough against Chelsea on Sunday . The German, celebrating the FA Cup win over Reading, needs to start performing to live up to his £42m tag . I've enjoyed some of Ozil's recent performances, he's been sublime more than spectacular, but he's definitely been a joy to watch. And so as I sat down to watch Arsenal face Chelsea, I felt confident that Ozil could be the difference between the two teams. I also felt that Arsenal could win the game, and win it well. And that if they did win it well, it would put huge pressure on Chelsea in the run-in. I felt there would be a chance that a big result for Arsenal at the Emirates on Sunday might just open the title door for the Gunners. But it wasn't to be. And come the big moment, the big player fluffed his lines. Ozil wasn't terrible but he didn't impact the game enough. While Cesc Fabregas was sending a killer pass only for Oscar to be wiped out by the goalkeeper (how is that not a penalty?), and Willian carved Arsenal up with the pass of the match to gift a great chance to Ramires,  Ozil was tidy, nothing more. Cesc Fabregas outshone Ozil on Sunday as Chelsea showed why they are ahead of Arsenal this season . Fabregas, who left the Emirates pitch with Ozil's shirt, would have been better than the German for Arsenal . Ozil takes on Cesar Azpilicueta in a game where he was fine, but not good enough to change the result . He didn't stand out. He didn't impact the game enough to affect the result. He didn't show any signs of being world class, or worth £42million. And then when he had the chance to be the match winner, Ozil completely missed his kick with the goal gaping right in front of him. Poor technique. In the second half Chelsea played into Ozil's hands. They effectively gave him the ball and asked him what he could do. If he's as good as he's purported to be, he kills off Chelsea with his ability on the ball. But he couldn't create the winning goal. For all of Arsenal's pivotal, meaningful, must-win games in the last two seasons, Ozil has looked average. Even in the FA Cup final last year it was Santi Cazorla and Aaron Ramsey who stood out, while Ozil failed to shine, complaining afterwards he was tired after his first season in English football. He was the most expensive player on the pitch on Sunday and come the end of his Arsenal career he will be judged on his impact. Ozil could go down the same route as Juan Sebastian Veron (left) and Andriy Shevchenko . When Thierry Henry says Arsenal need a new spine of their team, it's time to start listening . A player with a huge reputation signed for such a huge amount has to be more than just sublime. He has to have a major impact in the big games, he has to take the team to another level. Two seasons have gone and Ozil has failed to do that at Arsenal. There are other big signings with big reputations who have flopped in the Premier League – Andriy Shevchenko, Fernando Torres, Juan Sebastian Veron, and we're still waiting for the biggest of them all – Angel di Maria - to show us what he can do. Ozil could be joining that list unless he delivers something amazing next season. When an Arsenal legend like Thierry Henry points out that after all this time Arsene Wenger has constructed a team without a spine – Henry said they need a goalkeeper, a centre half, a defensive midfielder, and a top striker – you have to listen. He's right of course, but the knock-on effect is that the top players Arsenal have in their team need to deliver something extra special. And Ozil has failed to do that. In one of the biggest games of Arsenal's season, Ozil missed his kick when a late opportunity came his way . Arsenal fans are defensive of the Germany midfielder but that is merely a sign of their low expectations . Henry said what all Arsenal fans know, but most refuse to admit – Fabregas would have had a bigger impact in that team this season than Ozil has. There's a lot of goodwill from Arsenal fans towards  Ozil – they want him to be the hero, they want him to be their superstar. And that desperation means some have over-praised his performances. They're hoping it's some kind of twisted self-fulfilling prophecy – if they keep saying Ozil is brilliant, then maybe he will be. Witness this tweet about Ozil from Arsenal fan @girlgooner two weeks ago: 'I still can't believe he plays for my team Arsenal, I think we are very lucky, he's a very special player.' It seems you only have to sign for Arsenal these days to be a legend. That's how well Wenger has managed and manipulated standards and expectations at this once great football club. As for Ozil, he's been good. But he needs to be brilliant.","Mesut Ozil failed to deliver against Chelsea despite a perfect opportunity .

"The February afternoon we arrived in Adelaide, the mercury was whizzing up to a sizzling 46C and the South Australian city was the hottest place on the planet. The temperature had climbed above 40C for a whole week and even the Aussies were struggling. Appropriately, friends took us out that evening to dine in one of the city's hottest restaurants - Celsius! Luckily, it was air-conditioned and served phenomenal food. We especially appreciated the peanut butter and popcorn ice cream. But Adelaide that week was also hot for other reasons. It was the cycling mecca of the world, with 20 teams of Lycra-clad pros and their supporters tearing up the roads and hanging out in coffee bars. Sian Lloyd enjoys a glass of Clare Valley riesling at Skillogalee Winery north of Adelaide in South Australia . Sian meets Team Sky’s Geraint Thomas (centre) and Sir Chris Hoy (right) at the start of the Tour Down Under . Sian takes a ride ahead of the Tour Down Under in Adelaide (left) and meets a bouncy local kangaroo . The Tour Down Under is a big part of the international cycling season and contributes more to the South Australian economy than the F1 Grand Prix (formerly Adelaide-based, now in Melbourne) ever did. Not only was the launch night atmosphere electric, but it was great to catch up with our pals Sir Chris Hoy and Team Sky's Geraint Thomas. We also rubbed shoulders with the Indian cricket team. Howzat! We were staying at the Adina Apartment Hotel, the former Treasury building, where the old tunnels and cabinet rooms can still be seen. The Beatles hid here to evade fans back in 1964. Breakfast was served in the lovely oasis of the serene central courtyard, a delightful start to the day. The hotel is conveniently just round the corner from the splendid Central Market. A trip here is enough to convince anyone that Adelaide is the true food capital of Australia. And bearing in mind that some of the best wine is made within an hour's drive of the city, from the Barossa Valley to McLaren Vale, you feel very indulged. Adelaide is a much softer city than Sydney. It has charm, colonial history, sophistication and space to breathe. It's not called the City of Roses for nothing - there are lots of perfumed parks as well as wide boulevards.

It has charm, colonial history, sophistication and space to breathe . Most beaches are half an hour away, but being creatures of habit, we always head for the Adelaide Hills and the foodie haven of Hahndorf. Here we lunch on superb venison pasta and salted caramel crepes at a quaint old cottage called The White House. We then do a bit of wine-tasting in the scenic Hills and lovely McLaren Vale, arriving at the classy Currant Shed in time for supper. Set in a lime grove and bordered by vineyards, this is my husband's favourite restaurant in the world. I've had a thing about cycling the Clare Valley Riesling Trail for some time. Indeed, part of the reason for coming to sunny South Australia was to tick it off my bucket list. So early one morning we drove 90 minutes north of Adelaide, picked up our bikes from Riesling Trail Bike Hire and cycled along a 15-mile-long disused railway, snaking past vineyards and cellar doors. The gradients were gentle, the information boards fascinating and the tongue-tingling rieslings superb. We then treated ourselves to lunch at Skillogalee Winery, sat under a beautiful old olive tree and overlooking valleys lined with vines. The historic town of Hahndorf, settled by Germans near Adelaide, is a true blue foodie haven . The bright green of the vineyards of McLaren Vale, a popular wine regions close to Adelaide . North of Clare is where the Outback truly begins. And that's where we were heading - to the rugged Flinders Ranges mountains. It took three hours to drive to the majestic range, the largest in South Australia. The Flinders have a stark beauty - the light on the rocks, the vegetation, the bouncing kangaroos, all make you feel as if you're a million miles from civilisation. We stayed at Arkaba Station, a 60,000-acre sheep ranch, from where we did incredible guided walks, taking in the sights, sounds and smells of this astounding wild terrain. If you want to do the Flinders in understated luxury, this is the way to do it. Think cream and wood with cashmere blankets, scenic vistas, 4x4 wildlife trips, wonderful meals and languid cocktails at sunset.

Sian found the scale of the machinery mind-blowing in Kalgoorlie's gold mine 'Super Pit' And so to my husband's bucket list. Having travelled on the glorious Ghan from Darwin to Adelaide last year, and enjoyed every magical minute, he was determined to travel on its sister train, the Indian Pacific, from Adelaide to Perth. Frankly, I can't think of any better way of seeing Australia. You are treated like royalty, the food is outstanding and the huge views of this beautiful, baked continent are breathtaking. Two nights of cruising overland in air-conditioned splendour - it worked for me! As did the stop-offs, first at the Outback ghost town of Cook and finally at floodlit Kalgoorlie, the biggest open-cast gold mine in the country. The size and scale of the Super Pit and machinery were mindblowing. The same goes for the Nullarbor Plain which has hardly changed in millions of years. We crossed it on the longest stretch of straight rail track on earth - 297 miles without a hint of a curve. We arrived at the Indian Pacific terminal in Perth as fresh as daisies, and drove the three hours to Margaret River without stopping. But this is where we realised we'd made a big mistake. This was our first visit to Western Australia and to tag it on to the end of our holiday just did not do the region justice. The unique mining town of Kalgoorlie is  home to Australia's biggest over-cast gold mine . Sister train of the north to south Ghan, the Indian Pacific takes passengers from Adelaide to Perth . From the first step we took on the Cape to Cape Explorer walk with our guide we knew we'd found exactly what we wanted. The landscape spelt out AUSTRALIA. The views of turquoise bays and stretches of white sand, dotted with surfers, were postcard-perfect. Behind the beautiful Margaret River coastline, there are mysterious forests and caves. There's even a lighthouse where two mighty oceans meet. And then there are vineyards... In less than 50 years, Margaret River has become one of the world's greatest wine regions, gaining accolades galore for its cabernet sauvignons and chardonnays. Not only are you spoilt for choice for wines, but the food is up there with the best. Stand-out meals were the amazing breakfast at the luxury boutique hotel Cape Lodge, the special lunch hosted by the owners of Leeuwin Estate and the dreamy duck curry in the beautiful setting of Aravina Estate. The stunning coastline of the Margaret River, which is also one of the world's great wine regions . A special lunch was enjoyed with the owners of Leeuwin Estate in the revered Margaret River region . And how about sipping world famous Cullen red wine at the cellar door in the evening sunshine? This is the stuff memories are made of. We fell in love with Margaret River. Our last two nights were spent in a gorgeous villa at Injidup Spa Retreat, a peaceful paradise overlooking the Indian Ocean. It was such a stunning spot, and we were so relaxed after our massages, that we did not want to go out for dinner. Instead, we ordered hampers of local food from Lamonts Deli, along with bars of the local Bahen & Co Almond & Sea Salt chocolate, and ate splendidly at sunset on our terrace. We toasted the sun, sand and surf and vowed to come back.

A planespotter held with two friends in an Abu Dhabi jail has run out of medicine for his serious heart condition. Conrad Clitheroe, from Stockport, is in a cell with friends Gary Cooper and Neil Munro - also from Greater Manchester. But the 54-year-old's wife says he has now run out of a blood pressure medication - and claims guards 'don't care'. None of the men have been charged with any offence since they were transferred there from Dubai. They were arrested in February at Fujairah Airport over claims they were a 'threat to national security'. They were placed in a cell on February 21, missing their flight home the next day. A judge has since extended their custody licence, which will be up again on April 12. The families of Mr Clitheroe and Mr Cooper have paid £9,000 for lawyer Naseer Hashem – but claim he has been out of touch.

"A 73-year-old councillor stabbed his wife eight times with a seven-inch kitchen knife after discovering she was having an affair with the postman, a court heard. Joseph O'Riordan was sitting on Polegate Town Council in East Sussex when he grew suspicious his wife, Amanda, 47, was having an alleged affair and hired a private investigator to follow her. Brighton Magistrates' Court heard they agreed to stay together but O'Riordan later attacked her - stabbing her in the chest, torso, arms and back. Joseph O'Riordan stabbed his wife of ten years Amanda (left) with a seven inch kitchen knife eight times . The couple had been married for ten years when O’Riordan, who was also the president of his local Royal British Legion and had attended the Queen’s garden party in 2013 for his work on the Diamond Jubilee celebrations, discovered his wife was in a relationship with a man named in court as Nicholas Gunn. Mr Gunn had been the postman in the couple's neighbourhood before moving away from the area. After becoming suspicious of Mrs O’Riordan, a jealous O’Riordan used a GPS tracking device to monitor her car journeys and hired a private investigator to follow her. On the day of the attack, in October last year, the couple were at Mrs O'Riordan's mother's house to help with the shopping when the councillor received a call, believed to be from Mr Gunn. Giving evidence in a pre-recorded interview, Mrs O'Riordan said: 'After the phone call he came back into the room and I could see a shift in his mood. 'We left my mother's to get some food at KFC, and in the car Joe said to me, ""you can probably tell there is something wrong"". 'He then told me he had hired a private investigator and told me I had lied to him about previous phone calls I had received.' On the journey home Mrs O'Riordan tried to get out of the car, but was dragged back in and held down by her husband so she could not to escape. When they got home she went straight to the bedroom to dump her handbag and O'Riordan asked why she had not removed her coat. Brighton Magistrates' Court heard he hired a private investigator to follow his wife and discovered she was having an affair with their postman, Nicholas Gunn . She replied: 'I'm not sure if I am going to stay here, I might go back to mum's for a cup of coffee.' O'Riordan then left the room before returning with the seven inch knife and allegedly cried out: 'You have made me do this. This is all your fault.' He stabbed his wife violently before calling her an ambulance and admitting to the call handler what he had done. The court heard an audio clip of the 999 phone call in which O'Riordan can be heard saying: 'My wife's been stabbed in the stomach. She's bleeding really badly, she could be dying. 'It was me who stabbed her. She's lost quite a lot of blood. I want to look after her, it's me who's done this to her.' In the tape Mrs O'Riordan can be heard groaning in pain in the background before sirens sound and police arrive. She suffered life-threatening injuries including a collapsed lung in the vicious attack. Dale Sullivan, prosecuting, said: 'In the evening of that night, Joseph O'Riordan went from his bedroom to the kitchen and selected a knife before returning to the bedroom to stab his wife multiple times. 'The issue in this case is a narrow one, but it is simply this-on October 22 did Joseph intend to kill Amanda?'. Sussex police constable Steven Wilson said: 'Mr O'Riordan's demeanor struck me as unusual under the circumstances. 'He was compliant and co-operative and had a distinctive bored air about him.' O'Riordan pleaded guilty to wounding with intent but denied a charge of attempted murder. The trial continues.

"Sunshine smile: Judy Murray waves to the crowds . Her youngest son has only just tied the knot with his long-term partner Kim Sears. But Judy Murray has already wasted no time in revealing she simply ‘can’t wait to be a granny’. However, the tennis coach, who helped propel Andy, 27, and his brother, Jamie, 29, to sporting success, has a couple of caveats – he has to get the French Open and Wimbledon out of the way first. Mrs Murray, 55, who has carved out her own star status after appearing on Strictly Come Dancing last year, also said she would be a ‘very active granny’ and in the same way she coached her sons, she already has plans to introduce her grandchildren to tennis. She told Closer magazine: ‘I’m really looking forward to being a granny. I’ve always wanted to have grandchildren but I had to be patient and let them get married first. ‘I’m not sure when they will have kids as Andy has the French Open followed by Wimbledon, but I know he wants them. I will be a very active granny, that’s for sure – and I can’t wait to introduce them to tennis.’ Her words come only a few days after her son and his bride wed at Dunblane Cathedral on Saturday, drawing more than 3,000 well-wishers to the streets of his home town. Writing in the guest book of Cromlix House Hotel – a property Murray purchased in 2013 for £1.8million and where his brother got married – the happy couple thanked staff for their hard work around the top-secret event and signed as ‘Andy & Kimberly Murray’. The new Mrs Murray, who wore a flowing Jenny Packham gown, wrote: ‘Thank you to Graeme and every single one of you at Cromlix who worked so hard to make this weekend the best of our lives – a special place filled with very special people! X.’ The couple were among a handful of people who wrote in the public guest book at the hotel, which reopened to the public yesterday. Murray’s new in-laws, Leonore and Nigel Sears, wrote: ‘Thank you everyone at Cromlix for making it such a magical few days. You all make Cromlix such a special place where subtle magic happens xx.’ Glowing: Andy and Kim Murray after tying the knot at Dunblane Cathedral on Saturday.

He wrote: ‘Most adorable staff in the history of hotels.

"Earlier this month the tracksuit tycoon Mike Ashley agreed to buy a plot of land in Chelsea from the retailer John Lewis for somewhere in the region of £200million. The Clearings has been primed for redevelopment, with planning permission for 62 luxury flats, seven townhouses and an agreement to relocate Marlborough Primary School as part of the project. In five years, when the operation to build the properties is concluded and they have been sold to high-end buyers, Ashley will add something in the region of another £1bn to his net worth. There have been empty seats at St James' Park recently as fans let their feelings about Mike Ashley be known . The weekend defeat by Swansea was a seventh straight Premier League loss for the Magpies . Toon keeper Tim Krul had to pick the ball out of his net three times against Swansea . Ashley looks after the money, obsessing over the finances at his business empire, which includes SportsDirect, Tesco and his football club in the north east. Last year his group made more than £500m. In return, he expects his employees, across the board, to deliver. The biggest motivation in Ashley’s life is to make money, something reflected in Newcastle United’s latest accounts, which are showing another decent profit and £34m in the bank. The money men at Newcastle are already aware that the team could play in an empty stadium when the new television deals crystallise at the start of the 2016-17 season and still turn a profit based on current income and expenditure. It feels like it could come to that as Newcastle’s disaffected supporters wonder where to take their grievances to next. Ashley, the club’s owner, does not appear to be listening. He is not a football man, certainly not in the same way as the increasing number of disillusioned supporters at St James’ Park. After seven straight defeats in the Barclays Premier League under their interim coach John Carver, they have every right to fear for the future. All is not well. It does not help that Ashley has taken a neanderthal approach to negative criticism, frequently banning journalists from St James’ because they have gone into bat on behalf of the team’s disaffected supporters. For such a successful businessman, Ashley’s sensitivity to criticism is undoubtedly one of his biggest weaknesses. Ashley (right) has never been Mr Popular at St James' Park but the protests have been ramped up recently . A fan appeared to have a go at interim manager John Carver during the latest loss at St James' Park . The view from the bench hasn't been pretty for Carver and the Newcastle staff during the last few weeks . He should address it because his ability to make money should be one of his most powerful weapons at Newcastle. In January, after a deal had been concluded to take Alan Pardew to Crystal Palace, the former Newcastle manager gave a momentary insight into the financial strategy at St James’ Park. ‘Newcastle is a big club, it’s difficult because it is run on an tight financial margin,’ admitted Pardew. ‘We had to work hard on transfers, the funds for a club that size makes it difficult to understand that we had to build slowly.’ So what is so wrong with that, especially when the owner of the club still has an interest-free loan of £129m marked in the latest Newcastle accounts? It is the job of Newcastle’s chief scout Graham Carr, along with his staff, to identify and recruit the players who can improve this team. Talent identification is not Ashley’s area of expertise and he has always made it clear that it is the responsibility of his scouting department to improve the squad. The natural conclusion when clubs sell their best players, as Newcastle did when Yohan Cabaye moved to Paris Saint-Germain in January 2014 and Mathieu Debuchy left for Arsenal last summer, is to lose momentum. It always feels like a lack of ambition. Then there are teams such as Southampton, who sold four of their best players last summer - Dejan Lovren, Adam Lallana, Calum Chambers and Luke Shaw - for £88m after finishing eighth in the Premier League. Newcastle fans held a protest urging fellow supporters to 'show Ashley the red card' They responded by recruiting Dusan Tadic, Graziano Pelle, Fraser Forster, Florin Gardos, Shane Long and Sadio Mane for an outlay of around £56m. Under Ronald Koeman, who replaced Mauricio Pochettino last summer after he moved to Tottenham, Southampton could still qualify for the Europa League. They are a fine example to the teams outside the top four because Southampton (with an annual income of £90m), Swansea (£84m) and Newcastle (£110m) cannot compete on the same financial terms. Swansea, who beat Newcastle 3-2  last Saturday, have also had a recent change in management after promoting Garry Monk. He has had an outstanding year in charge. Toon fans held up the cards during the latest protest against owner Ashley . Even with the loss of Wilfried Bony, sold to Manchester City for £28m in January, they are on course for a top-eight finish because of their own financial prudence and some smart recruitment. Like Southampton, they are not living above their means, but their transfer policy is first class. They are being rewarded for that. Newcastle are currently 19th in the annual Deloitte report into football’s rich list, but they do not have the same financial muscle as Manchester United (£371m), Manchester City (£277m), Chelsea (£277m), Arsenal (£219m), Liverpool (£208m) and Tottenham (£153m). This summer Ashley will make some new signings, something they desperately need after a depressing end to the season at St James’ Park. Without them, the balance sheet will be the only winner.",Newcastle United have lost seven Premier League games in a row . Fans protested against Mike Ashley during the latest loss against Swansea . Ashley does not appear to be listening - he is not a football man . His biggest weapon is ability to make money - club has £34m in the bank .,b680247661269d4ad94cb3779b1cd71bbff1cb62
"Ed Miliband, pictured arriving in Manchester ahead of the manifesto launch, will today pledge to cut the deficit every year if Labour wins the election . Ed Miliband will today pledge to cut the deficit every year if Labour wins the election. In a last-ditch attempt to steal the Tories’ mantle as the party of economic responsibility, he will warn supporters that Labour faces coming to power in a ‘time of scarcity’. Launching the party’s manifesto in Manchester, Mr Miliband will claim ‘not one policy’ in it would be funded through additional government borrowing. He will insist a Labour government would ‘cut the deficit every year’ and have national debt falling ‘as soon as possible’, though he will not set a date. Labour’s manifesto, published last night, contains a commitment on its first page to a ‘Budget Responsibility Lock’. The party says this would be ‘the basis for all our plans because it is by securing our national finances that we are able to secure the family finances of the working people of Britain’. Mr Miliband infamously forgot to make any mention of the deficit in his party conference speech last year, and polls show Labour lags far behind the Conservatives in trust on managing the public finances. But Mr Miliband will today insist that Labour is ‘not only the party of change but the party of responsibility too’. He will accuse the Tories of ‘throwing spending promises around with no idea of where the money is coming from’. The Labour leader will pledge ‘strong, fair fiscal rules’ meaning the national debt falls and a surplus on the ‘current budget’ – applying to day-to-day spending, not capital spending – is secured ‘as soon as possible in the next parliament’. He will say: ‘The very start of our manifesto is different to previous elections. ‘It does not do what most manifestos do...It does something different: its very first page sets out a vow to protect our nation’s finances; a clear commitment that every policy in this manifesto is paid for without a single penny of extra borrowing. ‘The plan we lay before you is no less ambitious because we live in a time of scarcity. It is more ambitious because it starts from a clear commitment to balance the books.’ Policies in Labour’s manifesto include a £2.5billion NHS fund paid for from a mansion tax, a levy on tobacco firms and closing a hedge fund tax avoidance loophole. The Labour leader, pictured in Leeds yesterday after launching the health manifesto, will insist a Labour government would ‘cut the deficit every year’ and have national debt falling ‘as soon as possible' Scrapping the ‘non-dom’ rule could set Labour on a collision course with the Governor of the Bank of England. Mark Carney features among a list of heavyweight figures in the City who could be forced to pay higher taxes if Labour wins power next month. The Canadian is one of 116,000 non-doms in Britain, meaning he has to pay tax on his UK earnings but not on income generated overseas. Mr Miliband wants to scrap the tax break, describing it as ‘indefensible’. A spokesman for the Bank defended the Governor’s status, saying: ‘This is not a choice. It’s a straight outcome of the tests that determine domicile status in the UK.’ He added that Mr Carney pays full UK tax on his £874,000 pay package. Others who would be affected by the crackdown include the foreign-born chiefs of RBS and Lloyds. It will also commit to 25 hours of childcare for working parents of three and four-year-olds, paid for by increasing the banking levy, and smaller class sizes for five, six and seven-year-olds, funded by scrapping the free schools programme. George Osborne said Labour’s plans would ‘bankrupt’ the country, and put the 300-year-old union with Scotland at risk if the party were propped up by the Scottish Nationalists. ‘If you have an Ed Miliband/Scottish Nationalist government, they will trash this economy,’ Mr Osborne told the BBC’s Andrew Marr. He said the Tories had a ‘balanced plan’ to finish the job of restoring order to the public finances that involved cutting £1 in every £100 of government spending for a further two years. Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg accused Labour of ‘playing Russian roulette’ with the economy. Labour officials said ‘any government led by Ed Miliband’ would not compromise on the deficit. That will be seen as a bid to ease fears a Labour administration propped up by the SNP would wreak havoc with the public finances. ■ Labour would ensure Premiership football teams give millions to smaller clubs, Andy Burnham has said. The shadow health spokesman said it would enforce a Premier League commitment to invest 5 per cent of the proceeds from lucrative TV rights deals in grassroots sport. By Jason Groves, Deputy Political Editor for The Daily Mail . Labour yesterday admitted it cannot match David Cameron’s pledge to provide the NHS with an £8billion cash injection. The two main parties angrily traded blows over which would provide the most secure future for the Health Service. But independent experts urged Labour to back plans to plug a £30billion hole in the books. Shadow Home Secretary Yvette Cooper (pictured) repeatedly refused to say whether Labour would provide the £8billion funding . These plans, drawn up by NHS boss Simon Stevens, commit the service to making £22billion of savings, but also require an extra £8billion a year by 2020. The independent Nuffield Trust said failure to make the financial commitment would have ‘serious consequences for the viability of the service’. Chief executive Nigel Edwards said Labour’s stance was ‘regrettable’, adding: ‘The NHS has a plan, which has been endorsed by all leading organisations in the sector. Labour are now the only party not to have committed to this £8billion and yet their proposals are likely to require more spending on the NHS.’ The Nuffield Trust also warned that Labour’s ‘health manifesto’, launched at the weekend, suggested a return to the top-down management style it used when it was last in office. Mr Edwards said: ‘The level of detail set out in this [Labour] document is somewhat concerning. The NHS is complex and often responds best to locally driven initiatives. ‘There is a risk that elements of this detailed approach could trigger further reorganisation.’ Shadow Home Secretary Yvette Cooper repeatedly refused to say whether Labour would provide the £8billion funding. She said: ‘We will make sure the NHS has the money it needs and that’s what we’ve always done. ‘We’ll have practical measures that will raise £2.5billion – we can say where the money will come from, the Tories can’t.’ Miss Cooper also denied that Labour’s target to cut tax dodging by £7.5billion was simply ‘plucked from the air’. The party has promised to reduce evasion and avoidance by this amount by the end of 2017. But tax experts warned it would lead to a crackdown by HMRC on small firms – further souring relations between Labour and business. Challenged on the pledge yesterday, Miss Cooper said: ‘It is an ambitious and it’s a stretching target but we think it is right to do so because under the Conservatives the gap between the amount of tax that should be being paid and that is being paid has been widening.’",Miliband will warn that the party faces coming to power in ‘time of scarcity’ He will insist Labour would have national debt falling ‘as soon as possible' Manifesto also pledges 'Budget Responsibility Lock' for no more borrowing .

The physicians accused Dr Oz of pushing 'miracle' weight-loss supplements with no scientific proof that they work. The doctors wrote that Oz, for years a world-class Columbia cardiothoracic surgeon, has 'misled and endangered' the public. The letter read: 'He has manifested an egregious lack of integrity by promoting quack treatments and cures in the interest of personal financial gain.

"Manager Arsene Wenger is convinced something is finally happening at Arsenal again - and everyone can 'smell' it. The Gunners romped to a 4-1 win over Liverpool at the Emirates Stadium in Saturday's lunchtime kick-off, which was a seventh successive Barclays Premier League victory and moved them up into second place. While Manchester City could reclaim second by beating Crystal Palace on Monday and the title looks out of reach as Chelsea remain seven points ahead with a match in hand, there is no doubt when Wenger has all of his squad available Arsenal are capable of giving anyone a run for their money. Right back Hector Bellerin gave Arsenal the lead with a superb left-foot curling into the corner to get things going at the Emirates Stadium . Bellerin broke the Emirates deadlock for Arsenal, cutting in from his native right-hand side and curling a left-foot strike into the corner . Although there was disappointment at failure to progress in Europe following elimination by Monaco, the prospect of an improved league finish and successful FA Cup defence remains very much on the agenda. Wenger, who was often criticised over the direction of his team following almost a decade without a trophy, feels finally things are starting to come together. 'We have a good mentality and good cohesion in the team,' he said. 'There is something happening, that shows you that they are ready to fight for each other. Mesut Ozil is congratulated by his team-mates after his magnificent free-kick on the half hour mark put Arsenal fully in control of the game . 'You can see that, you can't cheat on that, people smell that. 'It of course is a good basis, and defensively we are getting better.' Following a poor start to the campaign, Arsenal were expected to struggle to sustain a place in the top four. Wenger, though, will not get complacent. 'I am old enough to know that things are never as comfortable as they look, but what is true is that it's in our hands. How well we deal with the situation now will be important,' he said. Alexis Sanchez celebrates with Olivier Giroud after his stunning strike from just outside the penalty area made it 3-0 to Arsenal in the first half . Wenger has his sights set on getting as close to Chelsea as possible, with the leaders set to come to the Emirates Stadium on April 26. 'I am a competitor and what that means is you have to go as high and as far as you can. When you go home if somebody was better than us, then 'well done', but we have to have given our best until the end and that is what I would like to do,' he said. 'Let's give everything to do it and see what happens. But Olivier Giroud ended any hopes of a Liverpool comeback by smashing in a fantastic fourth for Arsenal in stoppage time . 'We are in a good position, with four games at home and only three away. 'We are on a good run, so I would say that it will be down to how we can maintain that focus and level of urgency between now and the end of the season.' After failing to make the most of their positive start on Saturday, Arsenal had to soak up some pressure from Liverpool, with Raheem Sterling failing to capitalise when put in on goal. A huge flag is waved as Nacho Monreal and Giroud are among the first team-mates to congratulate the unlikely opening goalscorer . The Gunners finally broke the deadlock through the unlikely source of full-back Hector Bellerin, who slotted home a fine left-foot curling effort on 37 minutes. It proved the catalyst for an onslaught, with Mesut Ozil's free-kick and a rocket by Alexis Sanchez on the stroke of half-time effectively ending the contest. After Arsenal's tempo dropped, Liverpool reduced the arrears with a penalty from Jordan Henderson, but following the dismissal of Emre Can for a second yellow card, Olivier Giroud cracked home a late fourth to cap a memorable afternoon's work. Sanchez got in on the goalscoring act just before half-time, finding space outside the box to smash a drive over the head of keeper Mignolet . Wenger admits he has been impressed by the work-rate of both Bellerin and defensive midfielder Francis Coquelin, who were each drafted into the first-team as cover for injury, but are now an integral part of the side. Asked if either man was in his thoughts at the start of the season, Wenger said: 'Honestly, no. But my job is to remain open-minded and make decisions when you have to. '(I picked Bellerin against Liverpool) because of his pace. 'I thought (Daniel) Sturridge would play and then Sterling would have gone on the flank. Francis Coquelin challenges Daniel Sturridge During the Barclays Premier League match  at Emirates Stadium . 'Because of his low centre of gravity, Sterling changes direction very quickly and Hector is short as well.' Wenger added: 'I think you also have to give credit to players who get less, such as Coquelin. 'In the first half he broke up many attacks in a convincing way. 'But honestly I couldn't say that in my head (at the start of the season) Coquelin was one of the first-choice players.'","Arsenal maintained they superb run of form by thumping Liverpool . Arsene Wenger's side moved into second place following the 4-1 victory . Wenger believes everyone can 'smell' what is happening at the Emirates .

"Archaeologists  have uncovered a ritual burial of 2,000-year-old human skulls - sparking the theory they could be the remains of Boudicca's rebels - as the London Crossrail excavations continue. The latest discovery of cremated human bones packed neatly into a cooking pot and set off at the side of the historic River Walbrook, in London, has experts questioning whether they were part of a gruesome ceremony. When about 20 skulls were found buried in clusters in the sediment of the historic tributary in 2013 it had been thought that they had got there down stream after being eroded out of a Roman cemetery to the north - but new evidence suggests otherwise. Scroll down for video . New find: Around seven human skulls (pictured) dating back nearly 2,000 years have so far been found as part of the latest discovery by archaeologists at the London Crossrail site near Liverpool Street station . Roman rummaging: One of the skulls (left) was uncovered next to a Roman road which has also been found. A piece of Roman figurative pottery (right) was also dug up during searches of the site . Digging for history: A cross-section of the Roman roadside ditch uncovered at Liverpool Street station . The estimated age of the human remains and the way they appear to have been disposed of has led to the suggestion that the bones could even be Boudicca's rebels. Scientific tests are continuing on the cremated remains, with the possibility the grim ritual theory may be confirmed and that most of the seven skulls found so far are heads of  executed criminals and rebels. A spokesman for London Crossrail confirmed the team was working up a number of theories. He said: 'We don't have any answers yet but we are looking into it.' The Boudiccan Revolt raged from 60-61AD and saw British tribes, under Boudicca of the Iceni, unsuccessfully try to defeat the Roman army. Boudicca was Queen of the Iceni people, a British tribe who lived in what is today Norfolk and parts of Suffolk and Cambridgeshire. The revolt resulted in Camulodunum, now Colchester, London, and Verulamium, now St Albans, being burnt to the ground while thousands of people on both sides lost their lives.

The bones are to be sent away for further analysis . A long needle believed to be from the Roman period was also dug up. It will now undergo scientific tests . Revolt: Boudicca was Queen of the Iceni people, a British tribe who tried to defeat the Roman army . The Boudiccan Revolt raged from 60-61AD and saw British tribes, under Boudicca of the Iceni, unsuccessfully try to defeat the Roman army. Boudicca was Queen of the Iceni people, a British tribe who lived in what is today Norfolk and parts of Suffolk and Cambridgeshire. Her name is an early for of the more commonly known name 'Victoria'. Her husband, Prasutagus, was ruler of the Iceni people, and the Romans allowed Prasutagus to continue as king, ruling on their behalf. But, when Prasutagus died, the Romans decided to rule the Iceni directly and they confiscated the property of the leading Iceni families. The Romans are also said to have stripped and whipped Boudicca, and raped her daughters. The revolt resulted in Camulodunum, now Colchester, London, and Verulamium, now St Albans, being burnt to the ground while thousands of people on both sides lost their lives. Colchester was the first target of the Boudiccan army and many of the townspeople were rounded up and sacrificed in nearby groves. The Crossrail team spokesman said a connection was not currently being made between the skulls from 2,000 years ago and Boudicca's rebels but the possibility has not been ruled out. Work to excavate 3,000 skeletons from Bedlam burial ground, at the site of the new Liverpool Street station that will serve the cross-London rail network, has now been completed. It took a team of 60 archaeologists four weeks, working six days a week, to remove the remains and record evidence for what may prove to be, in archaeological terms, London's most valuable 16th and 17th Century cemetery site. Among the skeletons discovered at the burial site - used from 1569 until at least 1738, including the Great Plague in 1665 - were a mother a her child buried side-by-side. They have now been transferred to the Museum of London Archaeology (MOLA).

Crossrail workers are in the process of building a new ticket hall above the burial site - also known as Bethlehem and the New Churchyard - which was opened after graveyards around London started to overflow. It was used to bury London’s poor and religious non-conformists as well as patients from Bethlem Royal Hospital - the first dedicated psychiatric institution in Europe. Workers are now digging through medieval marsh deposits and Roman remains including a road that runs under the site. Archaeologists are expected to finish on site in September, after which construction will proceed on a new eastern ticket hall. Speaking last month, Jay Carver, Crossrail lead archaeologist, said: 'This excavation presents a unique opportunity to understand the lives and deaths of 16th and 17th century Londoners.

'The Bedlam burial ground spans a fascinating phase of London's history, including the transition from the Tudor-period city into cosmopolitan early-modern London. 'This is probably the first time a sample of this size from this time period has been available for archaeologists to study in London. 'Bedlam was used by a hugely diverse population from right across the social spectrum and from different areas of the city.' The Museum of London Archaeology is undertaking the archaeological excavations at Liverpool Street  on behalf of Crossrail. Scientific analysis of the remains will help provide new insights into the lives and deaths of early modern Londoners. So far, Crossrail has found more than 10,000 artefacts spanning many years of London's past across more than 40 construction sites. It is the UK's largest archaeology project. In 2013 and 2014, preliminary excavations at the Liverpool Street site in 2013 and 2014  uncovered more than 400 skeletons and numerous artefacts. The Crossrail project has already unearthed a number of exciting discoveries, including more than 10,000 artefacts at more than 40 construction sites. In 2013, workers made an 'unexpected and fascinating discovery' in tunnels underneath Liverpool Street Station, where the historic River Walbrook flows. The Crossrail team unearthed about 20 Roman skulls which were found buried in clusters in the sediment of the historic tributary. The Crossrail team unearthed Roman skulls in 2013, which had been buried in clusters at Bedlam . Working under the direction of archaeologists, the construction workers carefully removed the human skulls, as well as a collection of ancient Roman pottery. For safety reasons the archaeologists had to leave the work to the tunnellers as the skulls were buried as deep as six metres below ground. The discovery of the skulls and pottery was made below the site of the historic Bedlam burial ground. Bedlam hospital was a psychiatric asylum and patients who died while at the hospital were buried in a cemetery first established in the 16th century. Historically, Roman skulls have been found along the Thames tributary Walbrook during various excavations in the region. Prior to the discovery of the Roman skulls, workers also found about 4,000 skeletons buried in the Eldon Street area. These skeletons were found in August 2013 and were carefully removed during major archaeological excavations last year .","Seven human skulls, nearly 2,000 years old, have so far been uncovered .

"Tory election chiefs have given their candidates a letter-writing kit to target farmers, pensioners and women, leaked documents have revealed. A series of model letters have been drawn up with carefully pre-crafted messages designed to woo voters with just 28 days to go before the May 7 election. Women are told they are 'vital to the success of the British economy' while pensioners are praised for their 'wealth of experience'. A series of model letters have been drawn up with carefully pre-crafted messages designed to woo voters with just 28 days to go before the May 7 election . The letter-writing kit was revealed today as David Cameron made a campaign stop  at the National Grid Training Centre in Newark . Tory candidates are told to praise teachers as 'the best we have ever had' and tell farmers that they are 'vital' the party's economic plan, according to the leaked letter-writing guide. The letter templates are aimed at what party headquarters describes as 'target groups' in the electorate. Tory chiefs believe there are seven groups of voters who can be persuaded to change their vote in the run up to the election, including military veterans, pensioners, teachers and parents. The other groups Tory candidates are asked to target are women, young voters and farmers. There are also a number of letters 'written specifically for individual subjects', including defence, immigration and Europe. It advises activists: 'People are more likely to respond to a message from you if you write to them on an issue that they are directly interested in. 'This pack aims to provide you with pre-written examples you can use as the basis on which to write to people on issues that they raise.' The 37-page document, leaked to the Guardian, tells its candidates to tell women: 'Conservatives are committed to ensuring equal opportunities for men and women in all aspects of their lives. 'We are supporting women in work and providing greater financial security by reducing taxes, cutting the cost of childcare, addressing the gender pay gap and introducing shared parental leave.' Leaked documents reveal Tory election chiefs have given their candidates a letter-writing kit to target farmers, pensioners, women and other target voters - as well as advice on how to respond to questions about certain subjects . The letter templates are aimed at what party headquarters describes as 'target groups' in the electorate . The pack also says: 'Women are vital to the success of the British economy, and because our long-term economic plan is working, there are now more women in work and more women running their own business than ever before'. A pensioner who has raised an issue may receive a letter that says: 'Conservatives believe that if you have worked hard, saved, paid your taxes and done the right thing, you deserve dignity and financial security when you retire. 'We want a country where you get something for something, not something for nothing.' A Tory spokesman refused to comment about the letter-writing guide. But Labour MP Graham Jones said: 'This pack contains thousands of words but, as usual with the Tories, no answers. 'Rather than pumping out propaganda, what they should be doing is providing an explanation for their extreme plans, which would put the NHS at risk, and an answer as to whether they'll give millionaires yet another tax break.' Green Party activists have been told to dress in 'mainstream' fashion while knocking on doors in a bid to win over sceptical voters. A manual for the party's supporters urges them to appear 'level headed' and 'agreeable' – and even encourages them to compliment people's homes. The advice, which has been distributed among Green campaigners in London, also provides stock answers to ease voters' concerns about their radical plans to dismantle the army, legalise drugs and pay everybody £72 a week no matter how rich they are. A Green campaigning manual urges activists to dress in 'mainstream' fashion - unlike the campaigners pictured with the party's only MP Caroline Lucas at a fracking protest at Balcombe, West Sussex (above) It comes amid growing scrutiny of the Green Party's manifesto commitments after its membership surged to more than 50,000, outnumbering the Liberal Democrats and Ukip. But the party's surge in support was hit by a series of disastrous media appearances from the party's leader Natalie Bennett in which she struggled to explain her key policies. In February she suffered what she called a 'brain fade' on LBC Radio when she forgot the details of her party's key housing policies. Ms Bennett endured another tough interview yesterday - and was forced to defend her proposal to give every adult in Britain a guaranteed weekly income. She admitted the so-called 'citizens income' – which critics say would cost £280billion – would take longer than five years to bring in, and could take even longer. Ms Bennett also admitted that another Green pledge – to dismantle the Armed Forces and use weapons factories to build wind turbines – was also a 'long-term aspiration'. The party also supports leaving Nato and abandoning nuclear weapons. The Green manual for volunteers aims to ease voters' concerns over the party's radical platform.","Series of model letters  drawn up with carefully pre-crafted messages .

"British police helped Australian officials foil a suspected Lee Rigby-style terror attack on police during First World War commemorations, it emerged today. A 14-year-old boy from Blackburn, Lancashire was arrested after he allegedly communicated with Australian men over a plan to use knives and swords to hack officers to death in Melbourne on Anzac Day, which takes place this Saturday. When the alleged plot was uncovered by Greater Manchester Police, they tipped off Australian authorities who swooped on the terror suspects, arresting five men over the weekend. Police are now working to shore up security for a string of Anzac Day events taking place in London, including services at the Cenotaph and Westminster Abbey to be attended by the Queen, Prince Philip and Prince William. Scroll down for video . Arrest: Police have arrested a 14-year-old on suspicion of helping to plot a terror attack in Australia (file photo) Greater Manchester Police said today that the 14-year-old was first arrested on April 2 after police intercepted communications between him and an Australian man, allegedly relating to a planned terrorist attack. He was then re-arrested on Saturday on suspicion of being concerned in the commission, preparation or instigation of acts of terrorism, and is currently being questioned by police in custody. Five men from Melbourne were arrested over the planned attack after British authorities passed on their findings to police in Australia, and on Saturday 18-year-old Sevdet Besim was charged with terror offences. It was claimed today that the Australian men planned to knock over a policeman with a car then stab him to death, in a chilling echo of the murder of British soldier Lee Rigby two years ago. A security official told ABC that the terrorists then planned steal the dead officer's gun and go on a shooting rampage which would not end until they were shot dead themselves. The alleged plot is similar to the killing of Fusilier Rigby, who was run over by Muslim converts Michael Adebolajo and Michael Adebowale outside his barracks in Woolwich before they attacked him with knives and attempted to behead him. Attack: Sevdet Besim, pictured, has been charged with planning an attack in Melbourne on Anzac Day . Arrest: A suburban house in Melbourne where one of the alleged terrorist plotters was arrested on Saturday . Tony Mole, from the North-West Counter-Terrorism Unit, said today: 'We have uncovered communication between an individual in the North West and a man in Australia to what we believe is a credible terrorist threat. 'As soon as this information came to light we acted quickly with the relevant authorities here and abroad and this has resulted with officers from the NWCTU arresting a teenager. 'The nature of the communication is currently under full assessment and subject to investigation. 'We are continuing to work closely with the police in Australia and Lancashire and I want to reassure the public that we have not uncovered an imminent attack in the UK and there is no immediate threat towards the communities of Lancashire, the North-West and the UK.' Australian Federal Police said: 'Victoria Police and the Australian Federal Police can confirm a link between the arrest of a 14-year-old boy in Blackburn, Lancashire in the United Kingdom on Saturday with Operation Rising, a joint Counter Terrorism Team operation. 'The nature of the communication will form part of the investigation and therefore it would not be appropriate to comment further.' In the wake of the Melbourne arrests, Australian officials have ramped up security for Anzac Day events, while police in Britain  are reviewing the arrangements for Anzac Day celebrations in the UK. This year's commemorations are considered particularly significant, as April 25 marks the 100th anniversary of the start of the ill-fated Gallipoli campaign, which led to the deaths of 11,500 troops from Australia and New Zealand. Horrors: Soldiers pictured during the Gallipoli campaign, which left thousands of Allied troops dead . Commemoration: The Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh pictured laying a wreath at the Cenotaph in 1990, the 75th anniversary of the campaign; they are set to do the same during a ceremony on Saturday . London is hosting three commemorative ceremonies on Saturday - a dawn service at Hyde Park Corner, a wreath-laying ceremony at the Cenotaph on Whitehall and a service of thanksgiving at Westminster Abbey. The Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh are due to attend the services at the Cenotaph and Westminster Abbey, while the Duke of Cambridge will join them at the Cenotaph and Princess Anne will attend the dawn service. Security is already set to be high at all three events, with those attending told to carry photographic ID, but it could be ramped up further after the recent terror arrests. Deputy Assistant Commissioner Neil Basu of the Metropolitan Police said over the weekend: 'Following counter-terrorism arrests in Australia this weekend and allegations of attack planning against Anzac Day commemorations and police officers in Australia, we are reviewing security plans at related events in the UK. 'We already have protective security plans in place for major Anzac events in the UK but as a sensible precaution all forces have been asked to review security arrangements at related events to ensure they are safe and secure for the public and officers. 'While there is no information to suggest a specific threat to related events in the UK - and the current UK threat level remains unchanged - the public should remain vigilant.' At least 50 events commemorating Anzac Day are set to take place in other parts of the UK this weekend, including services at Manchester Cathedral, Winchester Cathedral and Oxford University. Australian police said on Saturday that Sevdet Besim and another 18-year-old were planning to use 'edged weapons' to attack officers in Melbourne while Anzac Day celebrations are taking place. The teenagers were said to be inspired by Islamic extremist Numan Haider, who was shot dead by police in September last year after he attacked officers with a knife outside a Melbourne police station. Like Britain, Australia has been suffering from an apparent upsurge in would-be jihadists as the rise of ISIS has attracted young Australians to fight in the Middle East and plot terror attacks at home.

"SS Sergeant Oskar Groening - known as 'the bookkeeper of Auschwitz' - is set to go on trial charged with complicity in the killing of 300,000 Jews at the Nazi extermination camp . An SS sergeant known as 'the bookkeeper of Auschwitz' is set to go on trial charged with complicity in the killing of 300,000 Jews at the Nazi extermination camp. Auschwitz survivors and the relatives of those murdered there filed into court today for the trial of 93-year-old Oskar Groening - who may well have met their loved ones shortly before they were gassed. They spoke of their pain, pride and duty in confronting this 'cog' in the machinery of genocide. Groening, known as 'The Bookkeeper' for his role in the camp in Nazi-occupied Poland, was tasked with meeting the trains bringing victims there and robbing those aboard of their possessions. Between May 16 and July 11, 1944 he was on duty when 450,000 Hungarian Jews were transported there, with 300,000 being gassed just after arrival. Now those who lost loved ones have travelled thousands of miles  to bear witness as co-plaintiffs against Groening in what may prove to be the last Nazi trial of its kind in Germany. 'I lost 49 members of my family in the Holocaust,' said Eva Pusztai-Fahidi, 89, from Budapest. 'He must have been there, on the ramp, witnessing the suffering. Now I want to look into his eyes and see him recognise his guilt. 'The Holocaust was made of small men like him, little cogs in the machine. It wasn't just big fish, it was people like Oskar Groening. It doesn't matter what his punishment is, but the verdict. The Holocaust deniers can always say a little old Jewish woman told lies. But they will not be able to deny the words of a single SS man who admits he was there.' Hedy Bohm, 87, travelled from Toronto, Canada, with her daughter to bear witness for her lost family. She too lost numerous family members, her father and his sister, together with her small baby, on the day they arrived. 'I am so grateful to have been given this opportunity to come here and testify,' she said. 'I don't know if I ever saw him. But he was there. And there can be no statute of limitations on people who served in such a place.' Groening, a sergeant in the dreaded SS, was in Auschwitz as a guard for two and-a-half years, but prosecutors are charging him with complicity in the murders of 300,000 people who arrived on 137 trains during the 48 day period of that summer in 1944 because of his intact service records. Auschwitz (pictured) survivors and the relatives of those murdered there filed into court today for the trial of 93-year-old Groening . Hedy Bohm (left) and Eva Pusztai-Fahidi (right), survivors of the Auschwitz concentration camp, take part in a news conference ahead of Groening's trial . Groening never denied being at Auschwitz and has been haunted by it ever since. He once admitted: 'I never really left Auschwitz - and it never left me.' But he denies a single instance of killing or cruelty - even though he witnessed plenty. Such a defence worked in Germany before 2011 and the trial of Sobibor death camp guard John Demjanjuk, but no longer. Demjanjuk was tried and convicted for being part of the machinery of mass murder at the camp where 250,000 Jews were liquidated without a single shred of evidence linking him to a crime. There was no-one left alive to testify at his trial in Munich for his role in the extermination of 28,000 Dutch Jews. No-one could say whether he slaughtered with his bare hands, but he was convicted, for the first time in history, simply because he was there - and that is why Groening now has his appointment with justice. Groening, who lives near the Lueneburg Heath - ironically the place where his boss, SS chief Heinrich Himmler, was buried in an unmarked grave after committing suicide when he fell into British hands at the end of the war - lived a comfortable life after the war. He married, had two children and worked as a wages accountant in a glass factory after being released from a POW camp in Britain. Groening was in Auschwitz as a guard for two and-a-half years, but prosecutors are charging him with complicity in the murders of 300,000 people over a two-month period in 1944 . He spoke at trials after the war of the operations of the gas chambers and crematoria but denied any involvement. Now a frail widower, he bears little resemblance to the young soldier with thin glasses shown in a black and white wartime photograph, except for the shadow of a military tattoo on his left arm bearing his 'O' blood type. Groening has said he volunteered for the Waffen SS in 1941 at age 20, drawn by wartime fervour and 'the elegance of the uniform'. But he testified to his nightmares in interviews before he was charged. 'Every night and every day I remember it for the nightmare it was,' he said. 'It was in 1942 that my SS chiefs in Berlin ordered me there. 'I was an official in the prisoners' possessions administration which basically involved removing the money, jewels and other valuables from the inmates, registering it and sending it back to Berlin. 'They had diamonds and gold worth millions and it was my duty to make sure all of it got to Berlin. 'It was completely understood by all that the majority were going straight to the gas chamber, although some believed they were only going to be showered before going to work. Many Jews knew they were going to die. 'One time a drunken SS man discovered a crying baby on the platform. He grabbed the waif by its legs and smashed its head against the side of a truck. My blood froze when I saw it. 'When I saw this I went to my superior officers and made an application for a transfer to the front, to anywhere. But he refused. Down the years I have heard the cries of the dead in my dreams and in every waking moment. I will never be free of them. 'It was becoming harder and harder to suppress everything I saw. On one night in January 1943 I saw for the first time how the Jews were actually gassed. It was in a half-built farmyard near to the Auschwitz-Birkenau camp. A gas chamber was built there. We were searching the wood nearby for prisoners who had escaped. Loved ones (pictured being interviewed before the trial) have travelled thousands of miles to bear witness as co-plaintiffs against Groening . Between May 16 and July 11, 1944 he was on duty when 450,000 Hungarian Jews were transported there, with 300,000 being gassed just after arrival. Pictured, Auschwitz survivors . 'There were more than 100 prisoners and soon there were panic-filled cries as they were herded into the chamber and the door was shut. 'Then a sergeant with a gas mask went to a hole in the wall and from a tin shook Zyklon B gas pellets inside. In that moment the cries of the people inside rose to a crescendo, a choir of madness. These cries I have ringing in my ears to this day. 'I again made an application for a transfer and at the end of October 1944 I was shipped to the Belgian Ardennes where I served with a fighting unit until capture. 'But you can imagine that down the years I have heard the cries of the dead in my dreams and in every waking moment. I will never be free of them. 'I have never been back there because of my shame. This guilt will never leave me. I can only plead for forgiveness and pray for atonement.' Kurt Schrimm, who heads Germany's sole Nazi hunting agency, prepared the case against Groening. Three more are pending against former Auschwitz personnel but age and infirmity seem likely to derail those proceedings before they begin. Judith Kalman, 61, also from Toronto, has travelled to represent her sister Evike,who was six when she was gassed upon arrival at Auschwitz during one of those days that Groening was on duty. She said: 'She never grew up. She will be a six-year-old child forever. A talented, cute little girl who taught herself to read. 'There is not only a shadow on my family, there is a shadow on my whole life. She was gassed 75 days after her sixth birthday on June 3 1944. What could have become of this talented, gifted child? 'I don't feel resentement or hatred when I think of Groening. I believe him when he says he never laid a hand on a Jew. He is unsure himself of his guilt. He wants to have peace of mind, to justify himself, but he knows there can be no justification. 'I will be there for Evika and for all the others who were murdered. I want to understand. He chose to participate in this crime and participated with conviction. And now, finally, he must answer for it.'","SS sergeant Oskar Groening, 93, faces trial for being a guard at Auschwitz .

But when Andy Murray and his long-term girlfriend tie the knot today, Kim Sears will have stiff competition from the mothers. Judy Murray, 55, who has had a makeover since her appearance on Strictly Come Dancing last year, is said to have spent months planning her outfit. But she could be outshone by Leonore Sears, 53, who has long been admired on the tennis circuit by gentlemen of a certain vintage. Scroll down for video .

"Nick Clegg today pleaded with Labour and Tory supporters to vote tactically to stop Alex Salmond in his tracks. In a highly-unusual move, the Lib Dem leader urged his rivals to help stop Mr Salmond from 'strutting his stuff' in Westminster. The former Scottish First Minister hopes to make a return to the Commons as MP for Gordon by ousting the Lib Dems who have held the seat for more than 30 years. Nick Clegg, who today visited diving equipment manufacturer Divex Global in Aberdeen, urged supporters of rival parties to help stop Alex Salmond returning to Parliament . Polls suggest the Lib Dems face near-wipeout in Scotland, with senior figures including Treasury minister Danny Alexander under threat from a surge in support for the SNP. Mr Salmond has chosen to stand in the Gordon constituency, where veteran Lib Dem Sir Malcolm Bruce is standing down. Today Mr Clegg was campaigning in Scotland, including a visit to a diving equipment manufacturer in Aberdeen. Alex Salmond has chosen to stand in the Gordon constituency, where veteran Lib Dem Sir Malcolm Bruce is standing down . He spoke out in support of new Lib Dem candidate in Gordon, Christine Jardine. He appealed 'to all those voters, they may be Labour voters, they may be Conservative voters, but voters who simply don't want to have their vote taken for granted by Alex Salmond'. He added: 'If you want to stop Alex Salmond pocketing your vote and dancing off to strut his stuff on the Westminster stage, the only way to stop him is to vote for Christine Jardine as the next MP for Gordon.' Sir Malcolm had held Gordon for the Lib Dems since 1983, but the scale of the challenge facing Mr Clegg's party was illustrated by a Lord Ashcroft poll in January which put the SNP on 43 per cent with the Lib Dems on 26 per cent. Mr Clegg warned that the SNP wanted to reopen 'old wounds' from the divisive independence referendum campaign that had strained families, friendships and communities. The Lib Dem leader said: 'That referendum was fought over months and years, it was fought with passion and vigour on all sides. 'But, let's be honest, it placed some strain on communities. Friendships were placed under strain as people differed on that fundamental thing. Even relationships within families were put under strain. 'The people of Scotland don't want to turn the clock back and reopen those wounds about that debate, they want to move forward.' Mr Clegg told reporters that the SNP offered the 'politics of division'. He said: 'When I speak to people in Gordon and elsewhere, they say 'Let's move on' - they don't want the politics of division from the nationalists, they want the politics of hope, of unity, of continuity.' Mr Clegg warned that the SNP wanted to reopen 'old wounds' from the divisive independence referendum campaign that had strained families, friendships and communities . Mr Clegg said it was 'possible' that the Lib Dems could come out of the election with more seats than Labour in Scotland . Mr Clegg dismissed as 'ludicrous' suggestions that it was hypocritical to urge supporters of other parties to back the Lib Dems to stop the SNP if he was not prepared to tell his voters to put their cross in Labour's box in seats where Ed Miliband's party is battling the nationalists. Speaking to reporters on his campaign bus, he said: 'It's not up to me to appeal to Lib Dem voters to vote for other parties, it's for other parties to make their case.' He added: 'Of course I am not going to start telling Lib Dem voters to vote for other parties. If other parties want to make a pitch to them in other parts of the country, it's a free country, they can do it. 'It's called a campaign. It's what happens in every single campaign. No party can win seats without reaching beyond their core vote.' Mr Clegg said he would 'let the SNP and Labour fight it out and talk to those voters'. 'It's not for me to start telling Lib Dem voters to do anything other than vote Lib Dem. What a ludicrous idea.' Mr Clegg dismissed as 'ludicrous' suggestions that it was hypocritical to urge supporters of other parties to back the Lib Dems to stop the SNP if he was not prepared to tell his voters to put their cross in Labour's box in seats where Ed Miliband's party is battling the nationalists . Mr Clegg said it was 'possible' that the Lib Dems could come out of the election with more seats than Labour in Scotland because of the damage the SNP surge could inflict on Mr Miliband's party. He said: 'I suppose that's theoretically possible. I try to avoid making predictions, but I'm quite seduced by that prospect.' Mr Clegg blamed Labour's failings for the current political landscape in Scotland. 'I've never in my adult political life seen a party so complacent about taking thousands of voters for granted, to the extent that when the SNP challenged them, they had no organisation,' he said. 'Particularly at campaign times, politics is the marriage of lofty ideals with gritty organisation, and you can't deliver your messages and ideas and you certainly defend them when they are being challenged, unless you have an organisation. 'And the Labour party, astonishingly, just basically let that organisation disappear, just wither on the vine...we'll see where it ends up but I suspect we'll weather the challenge from the SNP a lot better than Labour does.'

"Britain's first black prime minister will be a Conservative, David Cameron will claim today. In a bid to woo ethnic minority voters, Mr Cameron will say the Tories are the party of opportunity for people from all backgrounds who want to get on. He will also set out targets for ethnic minority recruitment designed to persuade voters the party is on their side. Scroll down for video . Mr Cameron will say the Conservative party will one day be the party of the first black or Asian prime minister . Highlighting Margaret Thatcher’s record as Britain’s first – and only – female prime minister, he will say: ‘We’re the party of the first female prime minister. The party of the first Jewish prime minister. And I know that, one day, we’re going to be the party of the first black or Asian prime minister.’ ‘I want this to be an opportunity country, where no matter who you are or where you’re from; whether you’re black, white, Asian or mixed race – whether you’re from the inner city or rural heartlands, you can make the most of your talents.’ The claim will be seen as a tacit endorsement of the leadership ambitions of Culture Secretary Sajid Javid, the only current Asian Tory seen as a potential contender. It is designed to tackle the Tories’ long-standing difficulty in attracting support from Britain’s growing ethnic minority electorate. The claim will be seen as a tacit endorsement of the leadership ambitions of Culture Secretary Sajid Javid (pictured), the only current Asian Tory seen as a potential contender . A report by the Runnymede Trust think-tank last week warned that suspicion of the Tories among ethnic minority voters could cost the party nine seats at next month’s election and 50 within a decade. Some senior Tories believe Mr Cameron has done too little to address the party’s reputation among ethnic minority voters – and warn that the party could face similar problems to the US republicans unless it acts quickly. Mr Cameron will today pledge to ensure that, by the next election, at least 20 per cent of Tory candidates in seats where a Conservative MP is standing down will be from an ethnic minority background. The figure this year is 18 per cent. At the time of the last census in 2011, 14 per cent of the UK population was identified as black or minority ethnic. But the Prime Minister will today set targets to achieve 20 per cent ethnic representation in the recruitment of police officers. The current figure is just 8.3 per cent. A 10 per cent target will also be set for the armed forces, to hit 20 per cent in the long term. At present the figure for recruits is 5.7 per cent. New targets will also be set to increase by 20 per cent the number of black and ethnic minority students going to university, being offered apprenticeships and getting jobs. Mr Cameron will say: ‘Our mission is to make sure that as our economy recovers, people from every community share in that prosperity. ‘But there are more specific things we can do to make sure we spread opportunity to every community. So I’m setting some ambitious but realistic aspirations for the next five years, specifically for the black and minority ethnic communities.’ Boris Johnson has said Britain needs to train more crane drivers and IT experts to stop migrants filling jobs. The Mayor of London claimed the UK has too many hairdressers and not enough young people learning to do the jobs the economy needs. He said the country’s IT industry desperately needs computer programmers, while building sites need crane operators – and both are often forced to depend on foreign labour. Mr Johnson said colleges had to work more closely with businesses to teach teenagers the skills they need to land well-paid jobs, which would help to reduce the reliance on migrants. He said he did not want to ‘tell talented foreigners to bog off’, but to ensure young people growing up in the UK were able to take the high-skilled jobs which have seen average wages start to rise. The Mayor, who is the Tory candidate for Uxbridge and South Ruislip, told MailOnline: ‘Do we need more crane operators and fewer hairdressers? I think the answer to that at the moment is yes. Do we need more people who can do coding for IT, the answer is absolutely yes. ‘We have a desperate shortage of those sorts of skills ... we have got to up-skill the UK labour force.’",Prime Minister says Conservatives will be party of first black or Asian PM .

"A leading bank official has been fired after being exposed as a Nazi-themed dominatrix. The 46-year-old had worked at the central bank of the Netherlands for eight years. However, for the past six of them, she has also been offering her sexual services at more than £300 an hour. Identified only by her ‘professional’ name, Conchita van der Waal, she asked clients for requests, saying ‘the kinkier the better’. Conchita van der Waal, pictured, offered a range of 'kinky' sexual services to clients from €450 an hour . Van der Waal’s website, which has been taken offline, shows a range of provocative images, including one of her wearing an SS cap. She advises prospective clients: ‘I have a challenging career in international finance. It takes me to many places (mainly western Europe and America). ‘Business meetings, elegant suits, lace stockings, garter belts, hold-ups, stiletto heels. If only my colleagues, clients or boss knew that at night I enjoy my hobby of being a hooker.’ Her online advert advises that she is a native Dutch blonde who is a ‘high-class nymphomaniac and prostitute’. She describes her greatest passion as ‘raunchy kinky sex with wild strangers and naughty men’. Quote, a Dutch magazine, reported that van der Waal had a ‘supervisory’ role at her country’s central bank while specialising in sadomasochism in her spare time. After the magazine broke the story, the bank confirmed it had fired her over ‘integrity issues’. Prostitution in Holland is legal although workers at the Dutch central bank are not allowed to engage in any activities which could bring the institution into disrepute, such as ‘indecent behaviour’. Van der Waal hinted at her real professional life on her website which has since been removed from the web . The Dutch Central Bank, pictured, told a magazine that van der Waal had been fired over 'integrity issues' It is claimed that van der Waal previously worked with ABN-AMRO, a state-owned bank based in Amsterdam. She is also understood to have worked for Dutch bank ING, which was fined £417million in 2012 for violating US economic sanctions. It is not clear when she was employed by either institution. According to her website, van der Waal’s work outside the financial sector was far more exciting. A picture from one of her online adverts shows the blonde sex worker sprawled across a zebra-print double bed. She wears a revealing leopard-print dress, surrounded by lit candles, champagne flutes and an ice bucket. The picture and the online advert vanished from the internet soon after her identity was exposed. But the images were captured and reproduced by Quote magazine before they were taken down. According to the Irish Times, van der Waal could face further action from Dutch authorities because she failed to register officially as a prostitute or abide by tax rules. Sex workers in the Netherlands must ensure they have a VAT number and pay income tax, none of which the woman has reportedly done so far. And she may also face difficulties because her ‘S&M studio’ is reportedly in a building where ‘immoral’ behaviour is specifically outlawed under the terms of the contract under which it was bought in 2012. Following the revelations, the Dutch central bank said it would review screening procedures for new employees. It said that of the 5,469 prospective staff who had been screened since 2011, 614 had been rejected. But the firm has been criticised by some in the Netherlands for treating the woman unfairly by firing her. Prostitution in the country was legalised in 2000 in order to protect women through better regulation and employment rights.","Conchita van der Waal offered a range of 'kinky' services for €450 an hour .

"Tensions between Marine Le Pen, the leader of the French National Front, and her father have escalated, as the 86-year-old founder of the far-right party defended having described Nazi gas chambers as a 'detail of history'. In words which will revive accusations that the far-Right party remains anti-Semitic, Jean-Marie Le Pen said he had 'never regretted' making similar statements in the past. His daughter and current leader of the party Marine Le Pen immediately distanced herself from the comments saying she 'deeply disagrees' with her 'deliberately provocative' father. Tensions between French National Front leader Marine Le Pen (right) and her father worsened today as the founder of the far-right party (left) defended having described Nazi gas chambers as a 'detail of history' Reigniting old tensions, Mr Le Pen, who is the founding father of the National Front (FN) and still an MEP, said: 'What I said corresponds to what I think. 'The gas chambers were a detail of the war, unless we admit that the war was a detail of the gas chambers!' During an interview on BFM TV in Paris, Mr Le Pen said 'the truth' should 'not shock anyone', and that historical reality should not be used to portray him as anti-Jewish. 'This case was manipulated against me by introducing a hint of anti-Semitism,' said Mr Le Pen. 'I challenge anyone to name an anti-Semitic phrase in my political life. 'Repeatedly questioned about the Holocaust, Mr Le Pen said: 'War is horrible, you know, a piece of shrapnel that tears your stomach, a bomb that decapitates you, a room in which you are asphyxiated, it's all pretty disgusting, it's true.' Firebrand: Reigniting old tensions, Mr Le Pen, who is the founding father of the National Front (FN) and still an MEP, said: 'The gas chambers were a detail of the war' Mr Le Pen's daughter, Marine Le Pen, is now the leader of the National Front (FN) and has tried to steer it away from its anti-Semitic and racist roots. Speaking to the website of Le Figaro daily about her father, she said: 'I deeply disagree with him. 'I take note of what he said but I believe that those coming over to vote for us understand what is going on. He is being deliberately provocative.' Ms Le Pen's party regularly wins up to 25 per cent of the popular vote at local and regional elections, and Ms Le Pen intends to stand for the job of president in 2017. Under her leadership, the party has deepened its roots across France, winning outright control of some town halls and getting its officials elected onto the councils of 'departements', broadly the equivalent of counties. Polls suggest she could make it into the second-round run-off of a presidential election but is unlikely to win. While other FN officials have been stripped of their party membership for racism, there has been no move to bar Jean-Marie Le Pen from a party of which he still holds the title of honorary president. He is popular with many FN members and will stand as a candidate in December's regional elections, despite having been convicted on numerous occasions of being anti-Jewish and for 'inciting racial hatred'. Distanced herself from comments: Speaking to the website of Le Figaro daily, Marine Le Pen said: 'I deeply disagree with him...He is being deliberately provocative' He has regularly made the comment about the Holocaust, telling the European Parliament in 2009: 'I just said that the gas chambers were a detail of Second World War history, which is clear.' Mr Le Pen was first convicted by a Munich court in 1999 for 'minimising the Holocaust' after telling a German far-right meeting that Nazi concentration camps and the gas chambers are 'what one calls a detail'. He has had a string of other convictions, including ones for violence and was briefly banned from being an MEP in 2003 following a physical attack on a French Socialist MEP.

We are all familiar with the brutality of ISIS, the self-anointed Islamic State, or Boko Haram, the Nigerian terrorists who have pledged allegiance to ISIS. This new wave of violent Islamist groups proudly brandishes medieval methods of cruelty through modern technology as a tool of recruitment and intimidation. But there is something very different about the way they treat women. The jihadi chiefs have a strategy beyond the battlefield. Their treatment of their female victims plays an important part in their ambitious radical strategy. Killing the enemy, the men, is a tactic for winning battles and conquering territory. What they do to women has an altogether different purpose: It is part of the larger plan of building a ""caliphate,"" a Sharia-ruled state complete with controls and norms harking back to the seventh century or, rather, to the group's interpretation of life in the early days of Islam. Yazidi girls who slipped ISIS after its siege of Mount Sinjar describe how they were sent to slave warehouses along with hundreds of other women. There, they were lined up in groups of 50 and displayed for ISIS fighters to choose among them, some for marriage, others for sexual slavery. The stories told to journalists or to human rights workers are confirmed by doctors who have examined the girls and say they have found evidence of repeated sexual assault. An investigation by Human Rights Watch found  ""a system of organized rape and sexual assault, sexual slavery, and forced marriage by ISIS forces,"" actions that the group says ""are war crimes and may be crimes against humanity."" In Nigeria, Boko Haram also has a very specific approach to women. The 276 students kidnapped one year ago make up a small portion of the 2,000 women and girls kidnapped by the group since 2014, according to  Amnesty International. There, too, women captives move from house to house and village to village, forced to convert when they are not Muslim, and prepare for marriage to jihadis. It's a stark change from the previous generation of jihadis, when Osama bin Laden headed al Qaeda. Women were not a big part of al Qaeda's immediate plans because al Qaeda, unlike ISIS, viewed the establishment of a caliphate as a distant goal, one for future generations. In contrast, ISIS is actively engaged in building those social structures. And if you want to build a new society, you need more than soldiers. You also need women. Women are indispensable for establishing a functioning community, even one whose laws are brutally repressive. Even if women are viewed as the property of men, they are still needed, not just for cooking, cleaning and sex, but to keep the home and raise children; hence the methodical capture, assault and subjugation. It is no accident that Boko Haram has targeted students, as it did in Chibok, or that Somalia's Al-Shabaab Islamists killed scores of women in the massacre at Kenya's Garissa University in Kenya. As in previous conflicts, women are spoils of war and rape is a weapon of war. It is a way to humiliate the enemy, a ""reward"" for soldiers and a tactic of ethnic cleansing. During the Bosnian war of the 1990s, experts said Serbian soldiers engaged in systematic rape, thinking the babies of raped Bosnian Muslim women would be Serbian. In Darfur, government-backed militias were accused of using mass rape to humiliate the non-Arab groups. But this is different. The women are not simply abused and discarded. ISIS and Boko Haram are enslaving them and incorporating them into the daily life of territories they rule, subjecting them to asphyxiating restrictions and abuses that have caused many of them to attempt suicide, according to some of those who escaped -- a phenomenon reminiscent of Afghanistan during the rule of the Taliban, another radical Islamic group that managed to take control and impose unspeakable rules for women. ISIS is going to great lengths to prove how its treatment of women, including the selling of Yazidi prisoners as slaves, is in keeping with Islamic law. Its online magazine cites Islamic writings proclaiming: ""We will conquer your Rome, break your crosses, and enslave your women, by the permission of Allah."" The worst fate is reserved for non-Muslims, such as Yazidis, but Muslim women in areas seized by Islamists have seen disaster. From Mosul, Iraq's second-largest city, a modern town until ISIS conquered it last year, women say, ""They have withheld all freedoms from us"" and describe oppressive, fear-filled lives. The brutality of the new jihadis is more than mere sadism. If it is madness, it is madness with a method. And when it comes to women, the method is one that aims to control them as a way to establish the society they envision, one where some women say life is simply not worth living.","Frida Ghitis: ISIS and other jihadi groups see women as crucial in role of caliphate they want to create . She says the groups want to enslave women, tie them to a long outdated view of how society should work .",ed2dbe0f8a7fc8ea761c4df1d2ecd23d571a8e1c

"This is the moment Jeremy Clarkson talked himself out of a ticket after leaving his bright green Lamborghini parked on yellow lines. Despite his recent woes, he was seen laughing with a traffic warden in London, who had tried to put a ticket on his borrowed supercar. The warden recognized the former Top Gear host immediately and the pair chatted for a few minutes. And the conversation must have been a good one - as the warden then appeared to walk away without leaving a ticket on the eye-catching Lamborghini. Scroll down for video . Jeremy Clarkson talked himself out of a parking ticket in London today after leaving his green Lamborghini parked on yellow lines . After spending 15 minutes inspecting a black Ferrari, Clarkson drove off in his eye-catching supercar . Clarkson was also spotted at Stamford Bridge, cheering on Chelsea as they drew 0-0 with Arsenal . Clarkson had met up with two people who were showing him black Ferrari Pininfarina 275. He was inspecting the car as if he may have had an interest in buying it. After spending around 15 minutes looking at the car, he drove off in his Lamborghini, which has Italian number plates. Clarkson, 55, was sensationally sacked from Top Gear by the BBC last month after a 'fracas' involving a producer during filming. This week Richard Hammond, 45, joined James May in confirming he will not return to Top Gear following Clarkson's sacking, insisting on Friday he had no plan to 'quit my mates.' Today, Hammond told reporters at a charity bike rally that the future will be 'exciting' but refused to speculate further on the future of Top Gear. The former Top Gear presenter stopped for a chat with tennis coach Boris Becker after the full-time whistle . Clarkson did not seem to entertained by the match between the two London sides, which was a bore draw . Jeremy Clarkson (left) is seen with his Top Gear colleagues James May (centre) and Richard Hammond (right) outside his west London flat this week, in their first public appearance since he was sacked . He said: 'Everybody knows what's happened. That's all been in the news. The future, nobody knows yet do they? 'And I cannot and won't speculate further than that. So don't know, let's see. It'll be exciting whatever.' Hammond's resignation marked another blow for the popular show, which has been marred by uncertainty since Clarkson was axed. There is mounting speculation the men are working on a new motoring series to be aired by Netflix, Amazon or another British broadcaster. Producer Olsin Tymon had his lip split by Clarkson in the March 4 assault and took himself to hospital with his injuries. The incident led to the BBC deciding not to renew Clarkson's contract after the current Top Gear series of Top Gear finishes. Police investigated the attack but Tymon told them he did not want to press charges and officers announced earlier this month they would 'not be pursuing the matter any further.' And Clarkson recently admitted had suffered a cancer scare around the time of the incident.","Axed Top Gear presenter was seen laughing with traffic warden in London .

"(CNN)The death of Freddie Gray, which was the flashpoint for the protests and now the riots in Baltimore, has raised again the questions surrounding  police use of force, especially after the now-familiar video of officers arresting Mr. Gray and loading him into a police van. Gray was arrested by police on April 12. The 25-year-old was carried in the van for 40 minutes and he was not properly buckled in, according to authorities. Gray's family said his voice box had been crushed and his neck snapped, and after a week of hospitalization, he died. Police Commissioner Anthony Batts has said, ""We know our police employees failed to get him medical attention in a timely manner multiple times."" The police and the U.S. Justice Department are investigating. The case raises at least three legal issues: . Believe it or not, the charging document in this case gives us more information than the now-viral video of the arrest.In that narrative, police state ""Defendant fled unprovoked upon noticing police presence."" According to the officers' words, that's the sole reason a stop was initiated. There is no other description of either criminal activity or safety concerns.  The next sentence is important too: ""The defendant was apprehended in [a specific location] after a brief foot chase.""  The police are locked in: it appears that by their own narrative that the unprovoked flight was the only reason for the stop, because the very next thing that happens...is the stop. Can the police stop you if all you do is run from them when you see them? For the most part, yes. But having grounds to stop is not the same as having probable cause to make an arrest. In this case, Mr. Gray took off running. The United States Supreme Court and Maryland courts have made clear that unprovoked flight -- running away from the police for no reason -- is enough to support reasonable suspicion that a crime has been committed. When you add to the suspect's flight the Supreme Court's recognition that the character of the neighborhood is also a factor in assessing reasonable suspicion, it appears that the police in this case had at least enough to justify the stop, constitutionally. Much to the chagrin of public defenders and defense attorneys, as long as an officer testifies minimally to an individual (1) running away, (2) in a ""high crime"" area, the stop will usually be ""good."" But police are supposed to articulate the additional safety concern to get to the frisk. Police must also have reasonable suspicion that the suspect may be ""armed and presently dangerous"" to additionally conduct a carefully limited search of the outer clothing for the sole purpose of discovering weapons. The charging document doesn't really identify a safety concern ... or does it? After the chase, and before an arrest: ""This officer noticed a knife clipped to the inside of his front right pants pocket."" Shouldn't that really say: ""I saw a clip but whatever it was clipped to was inside a pocket ... where I couldn't see it""? That's a close call: Police were lawfully at the stop stage, but the knife -- even though it was inside his pants pocket -- was visible from the outside ... because of an identifying knife clip? See how artfully that was done? Observation of a knife is definitely a safety concern. Observation of a clip? I suppose that will get the officer to the frisk of the pocket ... assuming he is a connoisseur of knife clips and can differentiate them from hair clips, chip clips, etc. According to William Murphy, an attorney for Gray's family, he was carrying a ""pocket knife of legal size,"" and the lawyer contended that police didn't see the knife before the altercation. The legality of the knife will be an issue, but police have essentially conceded that the knife was not seen until the stop. The important thing here is that a stop and frisk is not the same as an arrest. In theory, if a stop gives rise to no suspicion, and a frisk yields nothing more than a comb and some pocket lint, the citizen should be free to leave. An arrest requires much more: probable cause to believe a crime has been committed, and nothing less. That knife was the only crime he was charged with, so again, police are locked into a narrative by their own report. If it ultimately turns out to be a legal knife, there will be a lot of scrutiny on the decision to arrest. For example, if the ""knife"" was one of those pointy files attached to a 2-inch nail clipper, that does not sound like good faith probable cause for an arrest. Remember also that based on the police narrative in the report, they did not see the knife until after they seized Mr. Gray. So the question arises: What would they have done with Gray if he had no knife or other contraband on him? They could, but most likely not unless there was some intentional act that resulted in Gray's death. As we've seen, charging officers with crimes -- especially murder -- is rare and difficult. If you're pro-cop, you could say that's because they are well-trained and rarely abuse their force. If you have a more jaded view of law enforcement, you would say it's because they are well-trained, and consequently very skilled at testifying or explaining their use of force. Baltimore Police are suggesting Mr. Gray's injuries occurred after his arrest, while he was being transported back for processing, and that he may not have received proper medical attention. That's not a surprise. In fact, from a liability perspective, this is a good strategic move for the police. It will be harder to hold them liable if Gray's injuries happened after -- not before -- his arrest. Pre-arrest, Gray's ""seizure"" would be judged by a ""reasonableness"" standard, under the Fourth Amendment. However, courts have limited these ""seizures"" to the initial act of seizing the person. Any excessive force claims after the arrest are not covered by the Fourth Amendment. The claims of an arrestee are instead governed by a different constitutional provision: the Due Process Clause of the 14th Amendment. So what? What's the difference between the Fourth and 14th Amendment anyway? When it comes to potential civil liability of the officers, it makes a huge difference. The applicable burden of proof and chances of winning a lawsuit depend largely on which constitutional standard governs. Under the Fourth Amendment, the test is whether the force was objectively unreasonable based on the totality of the circumstances. Under the 14th Amendment standard, the officer will only be liable if the force was applied maliciously and sadistically for the very purpose of causing unnecessary and wanton pain and suffering. That's a much tougher burden for a plaintiff to meet. Fortunately, courts have held that pretrial detainees like Freddie Gray are entitled to at least the same protection under the 14th Amendment as are convicted prisoners under the Eighth Amendment, and its prohibition against ""cruel and unusual punishments,"" in this case the deliberate indifference to medical needs of prisoners. Confused? You're not alone. Even a Supreme Court justice has taken issue with this view of the Constitution. Other jurisdictions have actually opted to extend the protections of the Fourth Amendment after arrest, so not only could reasonable minds differ ... reasonable courts, judges, and states differ, too. It's just that Maryland is not within one of those jurisdictions. But it's true. It's a kind of unintentional ""gap"" in constitutional coverage, one the courts have struggled to deal with. Based on the law, it seems that if an arrestee is hurt during a ""rough ride,"" police might avoid liability in Maryland if they contend the injury was not caused wantonly or sadistically. That's a higher standard for liability than if Freddie Gray was hurt pre-arrest, so, if it's the truth, it just happens to also be a constitutionally convenient one.",Were the police justified in stopping Freddie Gray? Can they be held liable for his death?,388f63e252ef72ef3ad3c9f8f594d3d903fd0d33
"Student demonstrators who walked on an American flag to protest racism sparked a countermovement, prompting a south Georgia university to cancel classes Friday ahead of a rally that drew hundreds to Valdosta. Valdosta State University found itself in the center of a controversy after a video shared on social media showed an Air Force veteran and former Playboy model, Michelle Manhart, taking an American flag from demonstrators who had walked on it to protest racism. At the protest, held a week ago, Manhart was detained by police when she refused to return the flag. Big rally: Flag supporters attend a rally on Friday in Valdosta, Georgia that caused the Valdosta State University to close down for the day . Closed: Uproar over a protest in which demonstrators walked on an American flag has prompted a south Georgia university to cancel classes ahead of the rally expected to draw crowds of flag supporters to Valdosta . Struggle: Manhart, 38, is shown, left, refusing to release a flag which protesters were trampling on. In the right-hand photograph she is seen being arrested at Valdosta State University in Georgia . Hunt: Police said they traced the gun to a protester who was part of the flag-walking demonstration, and they issued a warrant for Eric Sheppard's arrest on charges of bringing a firearm onto a college campus . She later was banned from the campus of 11,500 students. She was not a student at Valdosta State, according to the school. The flag-walking demonstration involved three protesters, university spokesman Andy Clark said. Meanwhile, tensions rose at Valdosta State when campus police found a backpack containing a handgun on Tuesday. Police said they traced the gun to a protester who was part of the flag-walking demonstration, and they issued a warrant for Eric Sheppard's arrest on charges of bringing a firearm onto a college campus. Sheppard fled and has not been found by authorities, Clark said. Flag supporters gathered for a rally Friday afternoon, and university administrators said the possibility of thousands of people rallying on the outskirts of campus ultimately led to the decision to give students a day off. 'That level of traffic and that many people will disrupt a lot of things in the city,' Clark said. 'We're from an overall safety perspective looking to close the campus down today so they can have a peaceful rally.' Organizers of the 'Flags Over VSU' rally said they expected as many as 4,000 people Friday afternoon, WALB-TV reported . University administrators arranged for extra police to be on campus to provide security during the rally, Clark told The Valdosta Daily Times. Local law enforcement officials said the crowd that gathered was generally peaceful. Pro-flag: A flag supporter waves a large American flag while attending a rally on Friday in support of the flag . In support: Flag supporters on motorbikes attend a rally on Friday in support of Michelle Manhart . University administrators faced a backlash on social media after Manhart was issued a criminal trespass warning, essentially banning her from campus. Critics saw the university as siding with demonstrators who walked on the flag over a military veteran trying to save it. 'We were protecting their right to free speech and civil liberties' without taking sides, Clark said. NBC reports that some people T-shirts with the American flag and the words 'Try walking on this flag' written on the back and others carried signs. Cover girl: After her original feature, Manhart appeared in Playboy again. She is shown here on the cover of the Mexican edition . NBC spoke with Kim Thompson who drove 30 miles to join in the rally. 'I think it's going to be amazing. I think it's actually going to be part of history,' she said. Thompson, the wife of a sailor, said that after September 11 she became more patriotic than ever and felt that she needed to speak up after watching the flag get trampled. Michelle Manhart, 38, was handcuffed by police at Valdosta State University, Georgia, and driven off in a patrol car after grabbing the Stars and Stripes and refusing to return it to the student demonstrators last week. Video footage of the event, last Friday, shows Manhart struggling with officers, who force her to the ground after she refuses to let the flag go. It shows her surrounded by protesters on the campus, who demand their property be returned. In response, Manhart says the flag belongs to 'the entire United States'. Campus police try to convince her to drop the flag, but Manhart, a former training sergeant who served in Kuwait, refuses. Speaking to the Valdosta Daily Times about her intervention, she said: 'I did not want anything like this, but I got a call from a student who told me that the flag was on the ground, and they were walking on it. 'I was just going over there to pick up the flag off the ground. I don’t know what their cause is, but I went to pick it up because it doesn’t deserve to be on the ground.' She continued: 'If your cause is racism then find some white people and walk on them. 'But to walk on the flag is walking on our symbol of freedom. You have the freedom to do what you are doing because of it. I’m not fighting against them. I’m fighting against the way they are going about it.' Cause: Manhart came to the campus because she heard students were walking on the flag, as seen above . Air Force to bare force: Manhart was once a Staff Sergeant at the San Antonio Air Force training camp (right), but was demoted when she appeared nude in Playboy magazine. She is shown left holding a copy of the issue containing her spread . According to the Daily Times, the group didn't want to press charges against Manhart. However, police gave her a trespass warning, which bans her from the campus. Manhart has come under fire for standing up for her beliefs before. In 2007 she made national headlines - and lost her job - for posing nude for Playboy magazine. Explicit photographs from the periodical's February 2007 issue show then-Sergeant Manhart in a variety of provocative poses - first with, then later without - her military uniform. When Air Force bosses got wind of the racy feature, they relieved her of her duties at the Lackland Air Force Base in San Antonio, Texas. She was later demoted, and ultimately left the Air Force. However, she remained defiant, telling reporters at the time 'I didn't do anything wrong, so I didn't think it would be a major issue'. The decision brought an end to 14 years of service . She later appeared in other editions of Playboy - including the cover of the Mexican edition -  and posed for animal rights group Peta to support an anti-fur campaign. The Daily Times reported that Manhart now intends to hold a pro-military counter-demonstration in the town on Wednesday. In response to the incident, the university's president says he disapproves of the flag-trampling protest, but recognizes their right to express themselves that way if they choose. Dr William McKinney said: 'The American flag represents everything that is best about our country. As the Supreme Court has held, one of those things is the right to free speech, which includes the right to disrespect even the symbol of our country. 'While I firmly disagree with the actions of the protesters, I understand their right to protest.'","Hundreds protested an Air Force vet and former Playboy model's arrest when she tried to stop people from trampling on a flag .

He was arrested on Wednesday and detained at the Land O'Lakes Detention Center until he was released into the custody of his mother later the same day. Charged: Domanik Green, 14, allegedly accessed a computer at Paul R. Smith Middle School in Holiday, Florida, without permission by using an administrator's password to alter the image to two men kissing . According to the Tampa Bay Times Sheriff Chris Nocco said: 'Even though some might say this is just a teenage prank, who knows what this teenager might have done.' During an interview with ABC Action News, for which his mother said he could be identified, he said: 'I wasn't really thinking. I was just kind of annoyed at the teacher that day. He added: 'When I logged on and put the picture up, I was trying to annoy my teacher. Green managed to get into the teacher's laptop by sharing his screen. He then took a picture from Google images and enlarged it. 'But when logging onto the FCAT, I logged onto the wrong computer,' he added. 'I was trying to talk to my friend through another computer, that way I didn't get caught with my phone out or anything in class.' Green was also suspended for three days last year for a similar act. He and a number of other students got hold of the password. Booked: He was arrested on Wednesday and detained at the Land O'Lakes Detention Center (pictured) until he was released into the custody of his mother. The youngster says he saw a teacher type it in and was easy to remember, as it was a faculty member's last name. Green has been charged with 'offense against computer system, unauthorized access' which is a 3rd Degree Felony. He is also suspended from school for 10 days and is being transferred to a different school.","Domanik Green, 14, altered the background on the laptop at Paul R.

"Dogs are usually maestros when it comes to games of throw and catch - especially when there's food involved. But Fritz the Golden Retriever from California appears to lack any eye-mouth co-ordination skills, as a new video shows. The pooch was filmed wearing bunny ears this Easter trying - and miserably failing - to catch a hard-boiled egg between his teeth. Slow-motion footage shows him licking his lips and enthusiastically leaping up to catch the treat. However, despite his best efforts, the egg narrowly misses his jaw, bounces off his chest and hits the grass instead. A defeated Fritz is then seen hanging his head low, with his bunny ears falling to the ground. The pup has made quite a name for himself with his poor catching skills. Indeed, his YouTube channel boasts more than five million hits. Other videos show him being thrown steak, tacos, bread rolls, pizza and donuts, with misses every time. Fritz's owner, Evan Ball, hopes that one day the dog will be able to achieve the 'paw-fect' catch. He added: 'While we all intently anticipate the day when Fritz masters the skill of catching food in his mouth, we also patiently embrace the journey.'

"Planners in Windsor have allowed two Costa cafes less than 500 yards apart (file picture) Coffee addicts in Windsor won't have to go far for a fix – after planners in the royal borough allowed two Costa shops less than 500 yards apart. And anyone really desperate can always stop off at the Costa Express in between. The latest Costa will open on the site of the former Dedworth Road HSBC branch, the last bank in the area before it closed last year amid protests. Less than 500 yards away is a Costa which replaced a cycle shop earlier this year. It means there will be two Costas just a brisk five-minute walk apart, plus the Costa Express at a petrol station between them. One resident, Samantha Taylor, wrote online: 'I think it's mad and I wish our local councils could see that we are drowning in fast food and coffee shops in Windsor.' However, Matt Gordon-Smith said: 'The important point here is that this is in Dedworth which formerly wouldn't have had such businesses coming here. 'Surely places like Costa coming in rather than another fast-food shop or betting shop - there will soon be three within a mile - is that a sign that this part of Windsor is on the up?' Costa's planning application says the new shop would be a 'significant driver to local trade'. Planners said there was no legal reason to refuse. Costa were unavailable for comment.

"Libertarian icon Rand Paul has beefed up his campaign store ahead of his announcement this morning that he would compete for the Republican nomination for president next year. Like Paul, the Kentucky senator who made a name for himself by championing issues not typically associated with the GOP such as criminal justice reform and privacy protections, much of the 'Rand' 2016 SWAG is unconventional. Rand fans will still find the usual array of yard signs and bumper stickers. But they'll also have the opportunity to sport their support  through Macbook skins and woven blankets that feature Paul's face, 'Stand with Rand' flip-flops and car mats and a host of other unique items like the 'NSA Spy Cam Blocker.' Scroll down for video . Libertarian icon Rand Paul has expanded his campaign store to include an array of unconventional SWAG, including the 'Rand on a Stick' item feature above, as he kicks off his presidential campaign . An ophthalmologist by trade, the store contains eye charts bearing Paul's name and his campaign slogan because 'we need a president who can see clearly,' as the site states . For $75 Paul fans can own a throw rug featuring the Kentucky senator. It also comes in a Constitution theme for the same price . 'Sure it might be fun to have Rand in your living room at night engaging in deep discussions about objectivism, libertarianism, conservatism and a few other isms,' the description for the item reads. 'In the absence of that, curl up on your couch with the Rand blanket. It's the next best thing to him being there.' The freshman senator's expansion of his campaign store to include 'Paul for president' items preceded an announcement this morning on the website that said: 'I am running for president to return our country to the principles of liberty and limited government.' An unofficial candidate for the last year, the statement made formal the tea partier's entry into the 2016 contest a few hours before he was scheduled to hold a campaign kick-off in his home state. He'll spend the rest of the week rallying supporters in early presidential primary states New Hampshire, South Carolina, Iowa and Nevada, in that order, before making his back to Washington for his day job. The Senate is currently in the midst of a two-week break in honor of the Easter and Passover holidays. Loyalists of the 52-year-old freshman senator and his father Ron, a former Texas representative who sought the presidency in 2008 and 2012, are known for the fervency of their support and organizational skills. Tonight they'll celebrate the younger Paul's entry into 2016 competition with 'Stand with Rand' #LibertyKaraoke parties across the country. Running on the slogan 'Defeat the Washington Machine, Unleash the American Dream' and promoting himself as 'A Different Kind of Republican,' Paul's campaign store reflects the 52-year-old lawmaker's efforts to appeal to a new generation of conservatives- fiercely independent young adults who are just as likely to vote for GOP politicians as they are Libertarian candidates or nobody at all. Playing off the Stand with Rand theme, the description accompanying a pair of $20 sandals in the store says, 'no, really stand with Rand in official campaign flip flops.' Beer steins and t-shirts rock an 'unleashed' dog wearing patriotic sunglasses and holding an American flag in his mouth. The item bound to draw the most attention, however, is the campaign's 'NSA Spy Cam Blocker' that allegedly protects users from the preying eyes of the government. 'That little front facing camera on your laptop or tablet can be a window for the world to see you - whether you know it or not!' the item's page warns . For $100 Paul's supporters can purchase branded versions of cornhall, the bean bag toss game that's especially popular with the southerners from Paul's native region . And for $1,000 they can become the owner of an autographed Rand Paul pocket Constitution. 'It's size is perfect for comfortable carrying in the pocket of a sport coat, a purse, laptop bag or in the back pocket of some worn out jeans,' the site says .

Huh? 'These Rand Paul freedom paddles are printed on sturdy corrugated plastic and are great for rallies, parades, meetings, operas, church services that lack air conditioning and so much more,' the description reads.

"He's been at the sharp end of football for the majority of his career but a former Premier League striker seems to have met his match when literally trying his hand at another profession. Preston North End forward Kevin Davies has been through the wars during his 22 years in the beautiful game - being bumped and bruised by many an opposition defence. The 38-year-old isn't adverse to putting the boot in himself though -proven by the fact that he formerly held the record for the most Premier League bookings by a player with 99, alongside Lee Bowyer, before Everton midfielder Gareth Barry took that unwanted stat this season. Preston North End striker Kevin Davies tweeted a picture of his cut right hand after chainsawing on Tuesday . However, Davies' latest injury is self-inflicted as the England international inadvertently hacked away at his right hand while operating a chainsaw.

It's the second time in less than two months where Preston's No 9 has injured that part of his body. During Preston's FA Cup fifth round replay 3-1 defeat to Manchester United on February 16, Davies managed to play over an hour after team-mate Joe Garner accidentally crushed his left hand in the opening exchanges of the contest.

"Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger accepted his side were 'a bit lucky' after a fumble from Reading goalkeeper Adam Federici handed them a 2-1 extra-time victory and a place in the FA Cup final. The Gunners will head back to Wembley on May 30 aiming to defend the trophy after edging past the Sky Bet Championship side, who had rallied after going behind just before half-time to a fine goal from Alexis Sanchez. Reading drew level on 54 minutes when Garath McCleary's volley was deflected past goalkeeper Wojciech Szczesny, who could only palm the ball back over the line. Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger accepted his side were 'a bit lucky' to beat Reading on Saturday . Wenger's side failed to hit the level seen in recent games against Reading at Wembley . Although Arsenal did twice hit the woodwork through a header from defender Gabriel, which was touched onto the crossbar by Federici at full stretch, and a close-range shot by Aaron Ramsey, the Barclays Premier League side could not find a winner in normal time. In the end, an error from Australian Federici proved so costly, the keeper allowing a low, angled shot from Sanchez to slip through his legs and roll over the line on 115 minutes. 'It was a difficult game against a well organised, resilient, committed and physically strong Reading team,' Wenger said. 'They really wanted it Reading, they were willing to die on the pitch to go to the final and you have to congratulate them for the effort they put in. 'In the end, we were a bit lucky because their keeper made a mistake and I can understand that he is distraught, but as well he kept them in the game for long periods.' Wenger added: 'What was missing was a bit of speed of combination and sharpness in the final third maybe, but overall the concentration was there. Alexis Sanchez's low shot squirmed agonisingly through the legs of Reading goalkeeper Adam Federici in extra time . It was a routine shot from Sanchez but the Reading stopper failed to collect it properly in his grasp - an embarrassing gaffe . The ball rolled through his legs and slowly towards the goal line in the 106th minute of the game . Federici tries desperately to stop the ball going over the line after it rolled through his legs and out of his grasp . 'I don't think we switched off (for the goal), but after half-time we did not come on with the same intensity. We started to suffer and we paid for that.' Wenger refused to single out Szczesny for blame on the Reading goal. 'I would have to see it again,' he said. 'At first I thought it was not in because it took some time for the referee to give the goal, so I thought 'okay, we escaped'. Federici lies slumped on the ground as the impact of his error hits him in the FA Cup semi-final against Arsenal . 'But on slow motion maybe he goes back a bit to save the ball with his feet, then when the ball bounces, it was certainly over the line. 'We will have to analyse it, but the cross should not have come in and after the guy was free, so it was a combination of mistakes.' Wenger said an ankle injury to defender Per Mertesacker 'does not look good', which could make the German defender a doubt for Sunday's Barclays Premier League game against leaders Chelsea at the Emirates Stadium. The Reading goalkeeper, who had been magnificent until then, left the field in tears as manager Steve Clarke tries to console him . Arsenal reached a record 19th FA Cup final, and will be looking to overtake Manchester United's mark of 11 victories, with five coming under Wenger's tenure. 'Now, let's focus on our next game, we come back here in the final, but we have time to prepare,' Wenger said. 'The final is a 50-50 (game). If we can beat the record we will be very happy. 'Let's hope we have all of our players available and come back in good shape.' Federici's opposite number, Wojciech Szczesny (left) of Arsenal comforts his fellow goalkeeper after the game is resolved . Chelsea look in a strong position to go on and win the title, having defeated United 1-0 at Stamford Bridge on Saturday evening. Wenger said he was unaware of the final result when quizzed on its significance at the post-match press conference. 'I ignore completely what happened. Chelsea won 1-0? The usual,' the Arsenal boss said. 'We will see next week.'",Arsenal reached the FA Cup final despite failing to live up to recent form .

"David Crossley developed large kidney stones . Like many busy people, David Crossley often used to find himself so wrapped up in his working day that he would go without lunch, and often barely stopped for a cup of tea. In fact, David, 63, a musculoskeletal therapist from Birmingham, admits: 'I would often be so busy at the clinic that I'd forget to drink any liquid at all, other than the odd cup of tea or coffee. It had been the same way for years - although I would drink more water at weekends.' Last year, this habit caught up with him. He noticed a vague ache in his abdomen, stretching around to his back. 'It wasn't agonising but it just didn't feel quite right, so I went to the GP,' he says. 'As I had some bloating, he sent me for an ultrasound.' This revealed two large stones in his right kidney - a direct result, his doctors believe, of his low fluid intake. A CT scan showed that the stones were so large (6 mm across) they could not be passed naturally, and he needed surgery. One in ten of us will develop a kidney stone, and the numbers are rising dramatically. They are the result of waste products in the blood forming crystals inside the kidneys, which eventually build up into a solid lump. They can be excruciatingly painful - on a level, say experts, with childbirth. The stones often remain symptomless while they're in the kidney. They start causing pain - known as renal colic - once they travel down the ureter, the narrow tube that carries urine from the kidney to the bladder. 'Renal colic is caused by the stone suddenly blocking the ureter,' says Mr Leye Ajayi, consultant urological surgeon at the Hospital of St John & St Elizabeth, London. The pain often comes on suddenly and can cause the patient to 'writhe around in agony', he adds. The pain can be intense enough to cause nausea and vomiting. Once on the move, a stone can take days or weeks to travel out of the body. In that time, it may cause persistent or intermittent pain in the back, groin or side, a need to urinate more than usual, and pain when urinating. Sometimes, if a stone blocks the exit of urine from the kidney, it can lead to a build-up of bacteria and trigger a kidney infection. Signs of this include a fever, shivering, extreme weakness, diarrhoea, or cloudy and bad-smelling urine. The bad news is that the number of people developing troublesome stones is rocketing. Emergency admissions to hospital for kidney stones have shot up during the past decade by 136 per cent, according to official figures, rising from just above 5,000 to almost 12,000 per year. Meanwhile, the number of people going in for planned non-emergency treatment for stones has almost doubled in the same period, rising from 26,666 in 2004 to 51,340. The cause for his condition, doctors believe, was low fluid intake . And bizarrely, it may be that healthier lifestyles - doing tough workouts at the gym, and then not drinking enough, or shunning carbohydrates - are partly to blame, and may be why cases are going up, especially among women. 'More men than women used to suffer from kidney stones, with a ratio of about three to one,' says Mr Ajayi. 'But an increasing number of women now get them, and the ratio is evening up.' The main cause of kidney stones is dehydration. 'Your kidneys are your waste-disposal system,' explains Dr Kathryn Griffith, the Royal College of GPs' clinical champion for kidney care. 'They discard all the waste chemicals produced by your body, and they can do this efficiently if enough liquid is drunk to help flush them through. 'But if you become dehydrated, you overload the kidneys with urine that has a high concentration of stone-forming chemicals, and these begin to bind together to build stones.' To avoid this, you need to drink enough to ensure your urine is 'the colour of white wine', says Dr Griffith - around 1.2 litres a day. You need more during hot weather or after exercise. Changing diet trends are also pushing the figures up. 'There has been a trend, especially in people either wanting to lose weight or bulk up muscle, to eat low-carb, high-protein diets,' says Dr Griffith. 'The animal proteins found in meat and fish break down into a waste chemical called uric acid (a known stone-former) in your urine. They also reduce the amount of citrate (a stone-inhibitor). 'This can lead to uric acid stones forming, especially if you also don't drink enough fluid to assist the kidneys in their disposal job.' There are other causes, too. Your kidneys remove sodium, which is the main component of salt, from your body. When they do this, they excrete calcium, too. But low-carb diets could also put you at risk . So the more salt you eat, the more calcium you will have in your urine, which can build into stones. Obesity is another risk factor. 'Obese people are more likely to have insulin resistance (where the body can't use insulin effectively),' says Mr Ajayi. This causes a change to the nature of urine, making it more acidic, which increases the risk of uric acid stones forming in the kidney. Eating excessive amounts of oxalate is another culprit, as it can lead to the formation of calcium oxalate stones - the most common kind. Oxalate-rich foods include tea, spinach, rhubarb, nuts, strawberries, beetroot and chocolate. They are all fine in moderation, but avoid large daily quantities. If you have more than two urinary tract infections within a short space of time, you should ask your GP for an ultrasound to rule out a less common kind of kidney stone called struvite stones, which are caused by a build-up of bacteria from repeated urinary tract infections, adds Dr Griffith. Virtually all stones under 5 mm in diameter can be passed naturally, with only prescription-strength pain relief and medication that relaxes the ureter needed while this happens, says Mr Ajayi. But if a stone is bigger, you may need to have treatment. The most common is extracorporeal shock-wave lithotripsy (ESWL). This involves sending shock-waves of energy through the skin that break down the stone. 'This works for stones up to about 10 mm in diameter, but not for bigger ones, or for stones that are very hard,' says Mr Ajayi. 'It's also ineffective in most cases for people with obesity, as the shock-waves have further to go to reach the stone.' For bigger or harder stones, a ureteroscopy is performed. Under general anaesthetic, a thin scope is passed up your urethra and a laser is used to break up the stone. For very large stones (those over 15 mm), percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL) is used. A nephroscope - a telescope-like device - is inserted through a small incision in your back. The stone is broken up using a combination of high-frequency ultrasound and pneumatic energy (a bit like a pneumatic drill digging up a road). David Crossley had a ureteroscopy at the BMI Priory Hospital, Birmingham, in September. 'I was out the day after my surgery, and although there was some discomfort around my kidneys for a few days, thankfully I'm now stone-free.' He knows that a person who has had a stone has a 50 per cent chance of developing them again within five years unless they make changes to their lifestyle. 'The lifestyle changes that can be made to stop stones recurring are the same as those for avoiding them in the first place: proper hydration, low-salt, staying a healthy weight and reducing animal protein,' says Mr Ajayi. The British Association of Urological Surgeons advises that we should be aiming for no more than four of the following protein portions a day, two of which should be dairy to ensure you have enough calcium: 50-75 g of red meat, chicken or fish; two eggs; ½ pint of milk; 50g cheese; a small pot of yogurt. Mr Ajayi also recommends drinking water with lemon juice in it daily, as the citrate (a form of acetic acid) in lemons is a natural stone inhibitor that can prevent calcium from binding with other substances, such as oxalates, that lead to stones. Today, David ensures that he gets enough fluid. 'I didn't know that being too busy to drink enough could lead to kidney stones,' he says. 'I now drink water religiously!'","Doctors believe low fluid intake led to David Crossley's kidney stones . Ultrasound and CT scan revealed two very large stones in his right kidney .

"A virulent strain of bird flu continues to hammer the Midwest and the virus recently took its biggest toll yet after it hit a farm in Iowa that held nearly 10 percent of the state's egg-laying chickens. Poultry producers and scientists had been hoping warmer weather would knock down the deadly bird flu virus. But the U.S. Department of Agriculture said Monday that the H5N2 bird flu virus had been found at a farm in northwest Iowa's Osceola County - prompting a massive bird cull. Bird flu: Chickens stand in their cages at a farm near Stuart, Iowa. Discovery of the bird flu on an Iowa turkey farm has raised serious concerns that the bird killer could find its way into chicken barns in the nation's top egg-producing state and rapidly decimate the flocks that provide the U.S. with its breakfast staple . The confirmation means up to 5.3 million hens there must be destroyed in a state that produces one in every five eggs consumed in the country. Seven other Midwestern states have also been hit by the virus, dooming nearly 7.8 million turkeys and chickens since March. The virulent strain in question is the H5N2, a highly contagious virus that kills commercial poultry quickly once it gets into a barn. Yet the risk to the public is considered low and infected birds are being kept out of the food supply. So far, only two egg operations have been hit — the one in Iowa and one in Wisconsin. Except for a couple of backyard flocks, all the other cases in the Midwest have been at commercial turkey farms. Minnesota has had 28 turkey farms hit, far more than any other state. Turkey farm: In this photo provided by Bethany Hahn is a flock of turkeys at a Minnesota poultry farm. The country's poultry industry may have to live with a deadly bird flu strain for several years according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture . Precautions: Most commercial poultry barns are shut tight to keep the diseases out, and poultry farms with good biosecurity strictly limit who is allowed in - but is does not always protect poultry from bird flu . Officials say that's because Minnesota is the top turkey-producing state, and its thousands of lakes and ponds are attractive to migrating ducks and other waterfowl. H5N2 and other highly pathogenic strains have also been found since late last year among wild birds, backyard flocks and commercial farms in some western states and British Columbia. U.S. Department of Agriculture officials say the virus could be a problem for several years. The USDA's chief veterinary officer, Dr. John Clifford, said last week that while new cases should drop close to zero once the weather warms up and kills off the virus there's 'very likely' to be a resurgence this fall when the wild waterfowl that are natural carriers of avian influenza fly south for the winter. An outbreak that kills tens of thousands of birds certainly can cost a farm dearly. The government doesn't compensate producers for birds that die of the disease itself, but it does reimburse them for birds that have to be euthanized as a precaution. That gives farmers an incentive to report suspected outbreaks and deal with them swiftly. Outbreaks do not always drive up the cost of turkey eggs and chicken as the toll nationwide represents just a small part of U.S. production. Hormel Foods Corp., which owns Jennie-O, said Monday that it will sell less turkey this year because of the outbreaks. Turkey prices around the holidays often have nothing to do with the costs of production. Retailers often sell turkeys at a loss just to draw in customers who'll stock up on stuffing mix, cranberries, sweet potatoes, pies and other traditional favorites. However, several precautions have been put in place at farms to control the outbreak and stop the spread of bird flu. Most commercial poultry barns are shut tight to keep the diseases out, and poultry farms with good biosecurity strictly limit who is allowed in. Other precautions  include workers often having to shower on their way in and out, wear protective coveralls and step in disinfectant to kill viruses on their boots. Equipment coming in and out is typically sanitized. But despite these measures, the system doesn't always work. According to experts, the only way it can work is if everyone does everything right all of the time - which can prove difficult. And if rodents and wild birds sneak into a barn it can bring the virus that way. Farms tend to be extremely diligent at handling  bird flu as turkeys die quickly and know how to spit the early warning signs. Less severe symptoms can be similar to colds and flu in humans, or a flock turning quiet. While vaccines have been used around the world to protect flocks against various bird flu strains ahead of time, this strain is new to North America. Once an infection is confirmed at a farm, all surviving birds on the property are typically killed to prevent it from spreading. These flocks are usually killed by pumping a water-based foam into the barn, following guidelines from the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The foam suffocates the birds within minutes. If birds die they usually cover them in compost in the same barn where they died. Composting is a widely used and approved method throughout the industry to dispose of dead birds. It's thought to be an effective method as the heat generated by composting is enough to kill flu viruses and other pathogens commonly present in poultry such as salmonella. The compost is then used as fertilizer.","The deadly H5N2 bird flu virus has been found at a farm in northwest Iowa . Up to 5.3 million hens must be destroyed in the state to contain outbreak .

"Washington (CNN)Decision time for GOP operatives, another controversial foreign policy choice for President Obama, a ripple effect from the Robert Menendez indictment, and two insights into Hillary Clinton's campaign launch -- those stories filled our Sunday trip around the ""Inside Politics"" table. Obama's Iran diplomacy already has his conservative critics fired up, and things could get even more interesting in the week ahead. The President is headed to Panama for a regional summit, and Julie Pace of The Associated Press reports one of the big questions is whether he'll make history and have a face-to-face meeting with Cuban leader Raul Castro. ""This would be the first meeting between a U.S. and a Cuban leader in decades,"" said Pace. ""But Obama's efforts to end this freeze of Cuba have been a lot more difficult than they looked when he announced it last year,"" Pace said.  ""And so what the White House is going to be weighing is whether this meeting would be a way to generate more progress or whether it would be a premature reward for the Castros."" Hillary Clinton has leased her headquarters space in Brooklyn and will soon make her presidential campaign official. And with the launch, Jonathan Martin of The New York Times reports, will come a carefully orchestrated effort to reintroduce Clinton -- with an emphasis on her childhood and her earlier work on children's issues. ""The Democrats around Hillary Clinton believe that while she's one of the most famous people in the world, she's never been properly introduced in her own right,"" said Martin. ""So when she does roll out her campaign here in a couple of weeks, look for more biographical touches. We'll hear about her childhood in suburban Chicago and some of the work that she did as an advocate for the Legal Services Corporation and the Children's Defense Fund when she was in her 30s, and also, more about her Arkansas days as first lady, as an advocate for education."" A lot of the big names signing on to Team Clinton are already known. But Dan Balz of The Washington Post explains part of the statement her campaign wants to make with the announcement is to show it has a large, experienced staff ready for the key national and state roles. ""What I'm hearing is that when they launch, this staff is going to be even much, much bigger than we, at this point, imagine, that they have done a huge amount of hiring,"" said Balz. And Balz reports the planning centers on smaller events designed to highlight more personal interaction. ""She did an event with the wife of the mayor of New York earlier this week that could be a template for the kinds of things they're doing."" Much of the media attention on the corruption indictment against Democratic Sen. Robert Menendez of New Jersey has been on its allegations of luxury hotel stays with girlfriends. But beyond the more tabloidesque details, Jackie Kucinich of The Daily Beast notes that one of the charges centers on a suggestion the senator's staff was soliciting funds for a so-called super PAC -- a violation of campaign finance laws. And she says the scrutiny of that practice might grow because of the Menendez allegations. ""I was talking to some campaign finance watchdogs this week and they say if the (Federal Election Commission) really starts to look into this, they're actually going to find some impropriety with other lawmakers much much farther than Menendez,"" said Kucinich. ""So watch for that if it starts happening."" By a week from Monday, there will be three official GOP candidates for president: Ted Cruz, Rand Paul and Marco Rubio. Others will soon follow, and as things get more official, pressure is mounting on GOP operatives to choose sides. In New Hampshire this past week, Matt Maroney, a former Mitt Romney alum with ground organizing experience, signed on with New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie's team. Others in the state reported calls coming in from Ohio Gov. John Kasich and, yes, even Donald Trump. This dynamic plays out on the national level, too: Republican pollster Tony Fabrizio, for example, was approached both by Team Christie and by allies of Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker. In the end, though, Fabrizio signed on with Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky, who makes his official announcement on Tuesday.",White House weighing whether Obama should meet with Raul Castro .

"Harvey Weinstein's wife of eight years is furious and humiliated by the allegations that he groped a 22-year-old Italian model, according to a new report. Fashion designer Georgina Chapman, 38, said she does not want the accusations tied to Ambra Battilana and her husband to further embarrass their children or interrupt her business, a source told the New York Daily News. 'She's furious. She thinks it's embarrassing not only to her but to their kids,' said the socialite who worked with the couple. Weinstein, 63, has emphatically denied sexually assaulting Battilana during a March 27 business meeting at his Tribeca office. The source told the Daily News that Chapman, who has two children with Weinstein, wants to find a resolution to the allegations as soon as possible. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Forlorn: Harvey Weinstein's wife Georgina Chapman, 38, stepped out on Friday looking forlorn amid allegations her husband apologized to a 22-year-old model for groping her. He has publicly denied the incident occurred . Downcast: Looking down, Chapman carried the couple's four-year-old daughter India to their car in New York . A second source claimed Chapman, founder of fashion line Marchesa, is humiliated by her husband she married in 2007, and is someone who has 'loved Harry through his charms and flaws,' according to the Daily News. The question remains how much Weinstein is willing to pay to make the situation go away, the source told the newspaper. 'They want her out of the country,' said the socialite source. 'The last thing they need is her popping up at parties and premieres.' But a spokesman for Chapman denied the marriage was in trouble and said they had spent the weekend together. Max Dundas, a long term representative for Chapman, told MailOnline: 'This story is absolutely nonsense. I spoke to Georgina yesterday, they have spent the entire weekend together as a family and their relationship is as strong as ever.' In the meantime, Weinstein is waiting to see if the Manhattan district attorney will decide to seek charges before making his next move, according to the source. Out and about: Harvey Weinstein is pictured leaving his New York townhouse on Thursday, nearly a week after he allegedly groped a model.  He voluntarily spoke with authorities and is cooperating with their investigation . Accusations: Italian model Ambra Battilana, 22, told police that the Hollywood producer groped her and put his hand up her skirt during a 'business meeting' at his Tribeca office in Manhattan on Friday night . Max Dundas, a long term representative for Chapman, told MailOnline: ‘I spoke to Georgina this week, they spent the entire weekend together as a family and their relationship is as strong as ever.' A spokesman for Weinstein also told the Daily News that the idea the allegations were causing a strain on the couple's relationship was 'patently untrue' and that 'whomever is saying it, is lying'. On Saturday the couple were pictured at their Connecticut home. Weinsten was spotted outside the home. Chapman was seen rolling up to the compound in a silver Mercedes-Benz before she went inside. While he has denied the incident occurred, the source dismissed claims that the model had planned the encounter in an effort to land a movie role. As Weinstein fights to throw out the allegations, the New York Daily News reports that police overheard a phone call between Battilana and Weinstein, in which she confronted him - and he said: 'It won't happen again'. According to a Daily News' source, Weinstein appeared to confirm he groped Battilana during a phone call with the Italian national. 'She said something to the effect that she was uncomfortable with him doing that,' the source told the Daily News. 'And he said something to the effect, 'It won't happen again.'' 'He didn't deny doing what she said he did to her. The content of the phone call, there's no question about what he did.' Battilana has claimed Weinstein asked her for a kiss and groped her during a 'business meeting' at his Tribeca office in Manhattan on Friday night. DailyMail.com has reached out to his representatives for comment. Battilana also convinced Weinstein to meet him a restaurant and the NYPD were also there to watch that meeting, according to the newspaper. It is not clear if he knew he was being monitored but following the call and the meeting at the restaurant at the Tribeca Grand Hotel, Weinstein voluntarily went to speak with police on Saturday. Model: Battilana (pictured) claims he assaulted her at his office on Friday after meeting him at a red carpet event on Thursday night. Afterwards, she called police and they monitored a phone conversation with him . Beauty queen: Battilana is pictured left during the Miss Italia contest in Rome in 2011 and right in 2010 . He requested a lawyer and has promised full cooperation with the probe. Battilana's attorney, David Godosky, said Tuesday is the earliest he expects to hear a decision on whether Weinstein will face criminal charges, according to the New York Daily News. A legal expect told the Daily News that, if the DA decides to prosecute Weinstein, he will likely only face misdemeanor charges. The alleged incident unfolded at Weinstein's Tribeca office after he invited her there for a business meeting on Friday night, hours after meeting her at Radio City Music Hall on Thursday night. When she arrived at the office, the married father-of-five allegedly asked if her breasts were real before touching them and putting his hand up her skirt, she told police. He also asked her for a kiss, she claimed. She clearly rejected him and he backed off, the New York Daily News reported, and she fled from the building. Security footage shows the model speaking on the phone as she quickly left the building half an hour after arriving, the newspaper reported. Under surveillance: Following the alleged incident, she arranged to meet with him at the restaurant of the Tribeca Grand Hotel (pictured) and the meeting was monitored by police, according to reports . The model's lawyer said his client was 'creeped out' by her alleged encounter with Weinstein, who is behind hit movies including Pulp Fiction, The King's Speech and Gangs Of New York. 'When she was describing what happened, her face became contorted,' said Mark Heller. 'It was that look of someone who was creeped out. She's a very young woman who was relating her disgust that a much older man - an old man in view of someone her age - conducted himself like that.' Weinstein could face misdemeanor charges of forcible touching or sexual abuse if the allegations are credible. No charges have been filed and his representatives say they believe he will be cleared. 'We are confident that we will be fully vindicated,' a Weinstein spokesman said. A source close to The Weinstein Company told Page Six the groping allegations were nothing more than a 'blackmail attempt' and insisted that the award-winning producer 'did nothing wrong'. Weinstein's camp have dismissed Miss Battilana as an opportunist with a sketchy past. It has emerged that Battilana previously told Italian authorities she witnessed a so-called 'bunga-bunga' orgy involving disgraced Italian prime minister Silvio Berlusconi at his Milan mansion in 2010. She claimed she had seen young models performing stripteases and baring their breasts to be kissed by the Italian leader during a raunchy dinner party. Weinstein has been married to his second wife, 38-year-old fashion designer Georgina Chapman, since 2007. The couple have two young children together . It also emerged that she told Italian police in 2010 that she was 'forced against' her will into having sex for money with a 70-year-old 'businessman of substantial means' when she was underage. Battilana met the wealthy car dealer in September 2009 when she was under 18 and therefore below the age of consent for prostitution in Italy, according to Italian newspaper reports. In her police statement, she said the man invited her into his car, where he then caressed 'my hand and left leg' and proposed 'that I become his 'playmate', she said. Battilana said he then gave her a bag with €2,000, before assuring her it was only 'an advance of the €5,000 he would give me every month'. She added: 'Despite the indecency of the proposal, both because of my psychological subjection in which I found myself and because of the severe poverty of my family I felt forced against my will not to refuse the money.' The relationship ended after she was accepted into the Miss Italia 2010 pageant. Prosecutors in Italy asked for the rape allegation to be dismissed in 2012 but it was not reported whether the judge granted the dismissal - although it is likely it would have been carried out. In 2012, the Alba prosecutor told Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera that Miss Battilana never showed up to talk to them about her police complaint so they were unable to verify her claims. The alleged groping took place on March 27 at the Weinstein Company offices in Manhattan (pictured) where Battilana had met Harvey Weinstein to 'discuss business' After becoming famous through the Miss Italia pageant, Battilana began modeling professionally in 2011, according to social media. She works internationally in Milan, London, Paris and New York. She recently shot an editorial campaign for Bambi magazine in Agent Provocateur lingerie. Weinstein, who is originally from Queens, New York, founded Miramax studio with his brother Bob in 1979 and is worth an estimated $200 million. He is married to British-born fashion designer  Chapman, 38, who founded the luxury label Marchesa. The couple have been together for seven years and have a young son and daughter. Weintein also has three older daughters from his first marriage to his former assistant, Eve Chilton, which ended in 2004.","Weinstein's wife Georgina Chapman, 38, is seeking to find a resolution to the allegations as soon as possible, according to one of the sources . On Friday it emerged a sting set up by the NYPD shows Weinstein didn't deny touching Italian model Ambra Battilana - and apologized to her . She alleges he asked her for a kiss and then groped her during a 'business meeting' at his Manhattan office on Friday night . A source claimed during the recorded conversation set up under the watch of the NYPD, he did not deny touching her . The Hollywood producer has denied the allegations and has spoken to police, who have not filed charges . But a spokesman for Chapman denied the marriage was in trouble and said they had spent the weekend together .",5c09b29c6b6b147188a03c9d41cdae712898034c

"They're professionally trained to project their voices for stage and screen, so it's unsurprising that the nation's most popular actors might use one of their best assets to secure lucrative work with the best deals said to be worth around £50,000. However, while voiceover work might be a salary-boosting sideline, it can go down like a lead balloon with other employers, as Coronation Street actress Katy Cavanagh discovered to her peril recently. Executives at Coronation Street have reportedly just overturned a ban on their cast offering their dulcet tones to radio advertising campaigns after rumours of a near-mutiny among its actors, the catalyst for which was Katy's extensive voiceover work. Put a sock in it: In the past Corrie has reportedly tried to silence its stars when they've asked to do voiceover work for television adverts. Complaints from actors have led bosses to revise the ban . Katy, who played Julie Carp on the Coronation Street, pictured here on set with actor Jimmi Harkishin, has been the voice behind many ad campaigns including Whitbread, Lancome, iPlayer Restart and Nestle Kit Kats . According to the Sun, one of the soap's biggest names, Katy Cavanagh, who until last month played Julie Carp, was said to have been given a telling off for taking on a voiceover job for the BBC iPlayer Restart. The show's bosses were said to be disgruntled that Katy was lending her voice to a rival station and thus potentially advertising the Street's biggest competitor, EastEnders. Pressure from fellow actors is said to have caused bosses to relent and enable their 'talent' to take on radio voiceover jobs, although television adverts are said to still be strictly forbidden. For those actors not tied to tricky contracts, the voiceover world can be a very rewarding one with plenty of big-name companies prepared to put their money where their mouths are if it means securing a star that they feel might help them sell more of their product. From Benedict Cumberbatch to Cilla Black, it seems everyone is happy to get behind a microphone and cash in. Below, we look at the stars who've lent their vocal chords to various campaigns: . We could listen to him all day...Benedict Cumberbatch has occasionally branched out from acting to lend his voice to advertising campaigns. Brands that have snapped up the Sherlock star include Jaguar, Dunlop and Pedigree dog food . BENEDICT CUMBERBATCH . The Imitation Game star may be one of the hottest properties in Hollywood but that hasn't stopped the Sherlock actor from enjoying the other opportunities that have come his way. With his particular brand of well spoken English, it's unsurprising that upmarket car manufacturer Jaguar chose him to talk over their ads. A little more surprising is that Mr C also provided the audio for Pedigree dog food. Last summer, the star was paid a rumoured six-figure sum to help the dog-friendly company get their message across about pet dental hygiene. Woof, woof. NOEL FIELDING . With his wacky image and the coolest set of friends on the block, The Mighty Boosh frontman might not seem like someone who you'd naturally choose to advertise a mobile phone company but money talks and Noel Fielding can count Vodafone amongst his voiceover clients. THIERRY HENRY . He uttered the phrase 'Va va voom' and a million women fell in love. Thierry Henry, now playing football in New York, is still available for voiceover work but may never reach the dizzying heights of those Renault ads, which launched his career away from the pitch and also saw him marry his co-star Nicole Merry. The couple have since divorced. The Frenchman's other ads have included Nike and Pepsi. Pitch perfect: Olivia Colman's distinctive intonation has seen her voice used in plenty of advertising campaigns including for Andrex toilet tissue (pictured), Sainsbury's and Airwick . Money down the pan: Gavin and Stacey star Rob Brydon used voiceover work to boost his income inbetween jobs before making it big. Clients included Duck toilet cleaner . OLIVIA COLMAN . The Broadchurch star has become one of the nation's favourite actresses but can boast a surprisingly varied career in the world of voiceovers too. Thanks to her distinctive intonation, Olivia has laid down vocals for companies that include Andrex, Sky Box Office, Sainsbury's and Airwick. Now that Olivia is  expecting a baby at 41, might she turn to the less demanding world of voiceover work once more? BILL NIGHY . The Love Actually actor, 65, has a prolific voiceover portfolio, having got behind the microphone for campaigns for brands including Argos, Lovefilm, Expedia, Costa Coffee and Toyota. He's described by voice over agency Qvoice as: 'a cool, confident, sharp, witty and well-loved English gent with a distinctive familiar and trustworthy delivery.' LIAM NEESON . He's the proudest of Irishmen so it's no surprise that Liam Neeson might put his name to a campaign that would entice visitors to descend upon his homeland for a holiday. For St Patrick's Day this year, the Hollywood actor's velvety tones could be heard on the Tourism Ireland video promoting the Emerald Isle. Neeson said he was happy the 60-second clip would help 'nations come together to celebrate the fun and warmth of the Irish'. The gift of the gab: Liam Neeson recently voiced adverts for Tourism Ireland, which promoted visitors to the Emerald Isle ahead of St Patrick's Day in mid March . Plenty of cash: Eastenders star Shane Richie has used his cockney sparrow vocals to secure work for companies such as Sony Ericcson, Bounty and Plenty kitchen roll (pictured right) In 1973, Elvis Costello's father Ross MacManus sang the famous R Whites lemonade song, The Secret Lemonade Drinker. Acted by actor and mime Julian Chagrin, Ross lent his voice - and his son, who was then known as Declan, rather than Elvis - provided the backing vocals in the cult ad which ran until 1984 and featured a man in striped pyjamas creeping downstairs to raid the fridge for the fizzy drink. Elvis Costello's father sang the famous lyrics, 'I'm a secret lemonade drinker' in the R Whites ad . JULIAN CLARY . It's an instantly recognisable voice, charged with camp and irony. Comedian Julian Clary has supplemented his stand-up and television work by putting down his arch tones for companies such as WHSmiths, Argos and Direct Flooring. Clary is also the voice behind Little Princess, a show for toddlers about a mischievous young royal that appears on Channel 5. ROB BRYDON . Before finding fame in Gavin And Stacey, Dad-of-five Brydon brought home the bacon with various voiceover jobs; his Welsh lilt in demand by the likes of Tesco, Renault, Tango, Abbey National and Sainsbury's. The comedian has described himself as 'affable', a style which clearly goes down well with the nation's consumers. DERVLA KIRWAN . The Irish actress has plenty of stage and screen roles behind her including Ballykissangel and Goodnight Sweetheart but one, very brief, advert has put her into advertising folklore. When she seductively described a chocolate pudding for a Marks and Spencer's advert in 2005, sales soared. She said at the time: 'I went totally over the top. When I hear them on the radio I can't stop laughing. I can barely believe it's me.' The 'This is not just food...' advert was so successful it was reborn again last year...and spawned plenty of spoofs on the internet. NICOLA WALKER . The Last Tango in Halifax star has become one of the most popular faces on screen in recent years. Her voice is pretty recognisable too having provided the soundtrack for adverts for Nationwide, Toyota, Freeview and Max Factor amongst others. The right voice can make millions for a company, as Irish actress Dervla Kirwan proved for M&S in 2005 . How do you make a chocolate pudding sound sexy? Irish actress Dervla Kirwan managed it in 2005 for Marks and Spencer...sales promptly soared and the company used a similar format again last year . The higher end of the vocal range: The master of squeak Joe Pasquale has put his unique voice on ads for National Accident Helpline, while Julian Clary has camped it up for WHSmiths, Argos and Direct Flooring . SHANE RICHIE . As a leading character in Eastenders, Shane Richie's East End twang has long since been his trademark. The London-born actor has used his larynx to great effect in the world of voiceovers, using it to promote Jaffa Cakes, Bounty, Sony Ericsson and Plenty kitchen roll. JOE PASQUALE . The squeaky-voiced comedian has been blessed with one of life's more interesting-sounding voiceboxes so it's unsurprising that he's in demand. Previous work includes the National Accident Helpline and Camelot. JEANNE MARINE . Bob Geldolf's partner, French-born actress Jeanne Marine has worked her Gallic magic on adverts for brands including Evian and Citroen. SALLY LINDSAY . Regional accents can pull in the biggest contracts. Former Coronation Street actress Sally Lindsay has put her Stockport voice to good use in ads for Sainsbury's, Bet 365, Google + and Aardman. Northern charm: The Mighty Boosh star Noel Fielding advertised Vodafone while Happy Valley star Sally Lindsay has put her Stockport accent to good use in ads for Sainsbury's, Bet 365 and Aardman .","Coronation Street execs have ditched a ban on talent doing voiceover work . Former star Katy Cavanagh had been ticked off for doing BBC Iplayer ad . Show's other actors staged a 'mutiny', forcing ban to be overturned .

"While teenagers continue to post often-horrifying photos of the unpleasant side effects they’ve experienced after using a lip suction cup to give their lips a Kylie Jenner-esque boost, one male beauty blogger took steps to look even more like the 17-year-old reality star in a new video tutorial. Rolly Robinson, from the blog Beauty High, stars in theunique makeover clip, which sees him transform himself into a Kylie Jenner lookalike with the help of various make-up products and - of course - the infamous lip suction cup. To make himself over as 'America's sweetheart', Rolly first had to shave his mustache - and then he got to work using an impressive array of cosmetics to help him copy the appearance of the youngest member of the Kardashian clan. Scroll down for video . Just like Jenner: Beauty High's Rolly Robinson, left, transforms into Kylie Jenner, right, in a new makeup video tutorial . Pre-pout-puffer: Rolly did a remarkable job turning himself into a Kylie lookalike; before makeup, the editorial designer had normal lips, no cleavage, and a mustache . 'I decided to start the base off really light and build on top of it as I move along,' he says while starting to apply make-up to his face, rubbing color onto his cheeks. The editorial designer advises that viewers use a cosmetic sponge like one by Beauty Blender for a natural, seamless look. 'When contouring your nose, you want to make sure you really refine those edges so it doesn't look super duper sharp,' he continues while layering on highlighters and bronzers to create a slimming effect favored by almost all of the Kardashian sisters. 'You want to make sure nose looks as smooth and natural as possible.' Rolly also uses contouring on his chest, shading in circular motions to create the appearance of cleavage. Keeping up with cosmetics: The 'makeover guru' started off by applying a light base coat of make-up to even out his skin before contouring his face with darker and lighter pigments . Tricky beauty tools: Rolly used the controversial Fullips plumping suction cup, which teens around the country have been trying with some disastrous results - many of which are posted on social media . Moving onto the eyes, Rolly says: 'When putting on your [false lashes], make sure that you bend the lashes before you apply the glue. That way, it has the shape of the curve of your eye. And then when you place it, you just lightly press and hold.' He then uses a white eye pencil on his waterline, the sliver of skin between the eye and the lower lashes, which is a trick that he says will 'widen your eyes'. Finally, for Kylie's famous pouty lips, Rolly uses the controversial Fullips lip suction cup on his mouth for fifteen minutes in order to make his lips swell up and give the impression of a fuller pout. And while his use of the product successfully resulted in slightly plumper lips, teens across the country have been trying similar methods to make their lips look as big as Kylie's with disastrous results; many have experienced less favorable outcomes, with their lips swelling much more than they intended, while others, who have chosen to use other tools such as shot glasses, have cause permanent damage to their lips after accidentally shattering the glass around their mouths. Practically twins: After applying makeup and using the lip suction cup for fifteen minutes, Rolly, right, does a pretty good impression of 17-year-old Kylie, left . Social media makeover: The ultimate finish touch, Rolly puckered his pout and posed for a selfie a la Kylie at the end of the video . In fact, Kylie herself responded to the suction cup craze, writing on Twitter: 'I'm not here to try & encourage people/young girls to look like me or to think this is the way they should look. [sic]' Lucky for Rolly, the beauty expert seems to have mastered the Fullips device. Once his lips were plump, he overdrew them with a lip pencil like Kylie does, as extending the lip line creates a further illusion of fullness. While Rolly's edited video in less than three minutes long, the star herself recently revealed that her own beauty routine can last hours. 'A good night out is, like, two and a half hours for full makeup, curling hair, whatever,' Kylie told Teen Vogue. 'I'm never going to spend just 20 minutes, you know?'","Beauty High's Rolly Robinson uses a wig, contouring, and a Fullips suction cup to achieve Kylie Jenner's infamous big-lipped look .

"Nearly 500 British holidaymakers were stranded overnight on an impounded cruise ship in Lisbon harbour after its owners were served with a summons for an allegedly unpaid debt. The passengers coming towards the end of a 15 night cruise became the unwitting pawns in a legal wrangle between a former crew member and the owners of the MV Azores. The ship had been set to leave Lisbon at 7pm on Tuesday night with its 489 passengers heading back to Bristol Avonmouth after a round-trip tour that took in La Coruna in Spain, the Azores, and Madeira. But that was scuppered when lawyers slapped a court order on the ship over an 'unresolved' and 'historic' financial wrangle. The harbour master then refused to let the ship leave for Bristol. Scroll down for video . Stranded: 489 British holidaymakers were stuck in Lisbon on the MV Azores (file photo) overnight after its owners were served with a summons for an allegedly unpaid debt . Stuck: They were due to leave Lisbon for Bristol at 7pm on Tuesday but lawyers slapped a court order on the ship over an 'unresolved' and 'historic' financial wrangle . The ship is operated by Essex-based Cruise & Maritime Voyages. But the legal dispute was between owners Portuscale Cruise - from which they were chartering the vessel - and one of that company's former staff. The UK cruise firm, which had nothing to do with the financial wrangle, eventually came to an arrangement with Portugese authorities which allowed the ship to sail - 19 hours late - at 2pm Wednesday. It said passengers were kept informed throughout, helped with onward travel arrangements affected by the delay, and given access to a complimentary bar. One stricken passenger sent a text to a relative telling him: 'Can't believe we're stuck in Lisbon, Portugal. 'Our ship has been impounded due to an historical incident which basically means an unpaid debt.' The Madeira-registered 16,144-tonne, 525ft-long MV Azores was built in 1946. It has eight passenger decks and room for 550 passengers in its 227 cabins. Prices for the cruise range from £779 per person for a standard twin inner-cabin, to £4,159 per person for the owner's suite with an ocean view. The average price for the majority of cabins is priced at £1,500 per person. Cruise & Maritime Voyages's commercial director Chris Coates said: 'The delay of the MV Azores overnight in Lisbon related to a historic local issue with the vessel's owning company, Portuscale Cruises from whom Cruise & Maritime Voyages charter the ship using our own crew. Wrangle: The legal dispute was between owners Portuscale Cruise - from which they were chartering the vessel (file photo) - and one of that company's former staff . Going nowhere: The harbour master then refused to let the ship leave the port and passengers eventually arrived back in the UK 19 hours late . 'This dispute involved a previous crewing issue going back to 2014 and was settled first thing this morning. 'But we had to wait for the clearance documentation to be signed off by the local authorities. The ship is now heading en-route back to the UK.' He added: 'On behalf of Cruise & Maritime Voyages, I would like to extend our sincere apologises for the delay and any disruption caused.' Coates said his company, set up in 2010, carries more than 100,000 ocean and river cruise passengers a year and had 'never experienced a delay of this nature before'. Luxurious: The average price for the majority of cabins on the MV Azores is priced at £1,500 per person . The firm's online brochure says of the MV Azores: 'With her handsome profile and a traditional walk around promenade deck, the 16,144grt Portuguese registered Azores is a classic beautifully restored ocean going cruise ship carrying just 550 guests and offers a wide selection of very well appointed and comfortable public lounges and cabin accommodation spanning eight passenger decks serviced by two lifts.' It features a choice of five comfortable lounges and bars including the Calypso main show lounge, plus a nightclub, cinema, casino, shopping boutique, photo shop, library, card and bridge room, fitness and health centre with sauna and massage facilities, an unheated outdoor swimming pool and a marbled reception area. Most cabins enjoy an ocean view and all the private en-suite cabins have a bath with shower, a hairdryer and personal safe, a TV for movies and news and information channels and a fridge with a mini bar facility.","Nearly 500 British holidaymakers were stranded on the MV Azores all night .

"Gary Caldwell admitted his first taste of management was 'crazy' following Wigan's battling 2-2 draw against Fulham. The Latics may be heading for relegation but they proved they are ready to go down fighting after twice coming from behind to snatch a point at Craven Cottage. Caldwell, at 32 the youngest boss in the league, only replaced the axed Malky Mackay on Wednesday and must have feared the worst when his side conceded after just three minutes to Ross McCormack's strike. Gary Caldwell admitted his first taste of management was 'crazy' following Wigan's battling 2-2 draw . Wigan's Jason Pearce (right) is congratulated by Pennant (left) as he scores the second equaliser for his side . A stylish Jermaine Pennant free-kick hauled Wigan level, only for a stunning long-range effort from Matt Smith put Fulham back in front. But Jason Pearce's 69th-minute effort, when he tucked in a corner at the far post, earned the Latics a point. 'I have just said to the players that I feel very proud of them considering we only had two days to work,' said former Latics skipper Caldwell. 'It's crazy, absolutely crazy. An all-consuming job. But I loved every minute of it and can't wait for the next one. I've had a lot of managers texting me saying 'welcome to the madhouse' and I can see what they mean.' A point lifted Wigan above Millwall, who they face on Tuesday, on goal difference but both teams are seven points adrift of safety. Matt Smith scores Fulham's second goal to restore their lead against Wigan at Carven Cottage on Friday . Smith slides to his knees as he celebrates putting the home side back in front in the Championship match . Caldwell has not been put in charge to perform a miracle, but he still insists there is plenty to play for. 'We'll try to win every game,' he added. 'There's 12 points to play for and we'll try to win every one and see what happens. 'It's going to be a long process to get the club to where we want it to be. But tonight was the way we want to play, that's how this club got success.' Fulham should now be safe, having edged nine points clear of the drop zone, but they were booed off by sections of the home support. Boss Kit Symons' honeymoon period seems to be over, as his decision to take off goalscorer Smith after an hour was met with a chorus of 'you don't know what you're doing'.

'He's had a lot of football recently and we needed some fresh legs.' Symons has the air of a manager who cannot wait for the season to come to an end. 'It's glass half full, glass half empty,' he added. 'We're a point closer to safety and come the end of the season it might be the point that keeps us in the division. 'It's been a tough season, to put it mildly, and realistically it was probably always going to be like that.

"Shanghai, China (CNN)Volvo says it will begin exporting vehicles made in a factory in southwest China to the United States next month, the first time Chinese-built passenger cars will roll into American showrooms. Parent company Geely Automobile, which bought Volvo in 2010, is seeking to prove that a Chinese company can manage a global auto brand. Geely's gambit will be watched to see if it paves the way for other Chinese car manufacturers to crack developed markets. CEO Håkan Samuelsson said Volvo planned to sell 1,500 Chinese-made S60 Inscription sedans in 2015 and 5,000 annually in subsequent years. For many U.S. consumers, China is still more closely linked with cheap clothing and electronics than luxury vehicles, but Samuelsson downplayed any concerns about quality. ""We don't highlight where the vehicle is built but we don't keep it a secret. We sell them as Volvos and we know they are exactly the same in quality no matter where they are produced,"" he told CNN. The car will be one of four models produced in a manufacturing plant in Chengdu that opened in 2013. But given that Volvo's brand is staked on its reputation for safety, analysts said the company will have to tread carefully. ""They have a strong enough reputation no matter where they're made. They will have to make sure they don't ruin that perception with any quality issues,"" said Raymond Tsang, a Shanghai-based partner at consultants Bain & Company. China surpassed the U.S. as the largest market for car sales globally in 2009, and most major automakers build cars in China. But until now those cars have been sold almost exclusively in China. Chinese car manufacturers like Geely and its rival Great Wall Motor do export their models to countries in Africa, the Middle East and Eastern Europe. But none have so far dared tackle developed markets like the U.S. and Western Europe. Geely chairman Li Shufu said he hoped the company would eventually become a global car brand, but said there were no current plans to begin export its home-grown brand to U.S. showrooms. ""We have the ambition, yes; determination yes, but I'm also [a] very realistic person,"" he said. Industry analysts say it's unlikely we will see Chinese car makers shake up the U.S. car market in the same way Japanese and South Korean manufacturers did decades earlier, at least in the near future. ""Hyundai and Toyota are now extremely successful but it took them decades to move away from being perceived as lower end and lower quality than U.S. cars,"" said Tsang. ""And now the market is even more competitive, especially for entry level models.""

"Unfit driver: According to Houston city codes - Duncan Burton should not have been driving because of a prior drugs conviction . A Houston Uber driver arrested and charged last week with sexually assaulting a female passenger was granted approval to drive for the car service despite being a convicted cocaine dealer. Duncan Burton, 57, was released in November 2012 after 14-years behind bars but was allowed to work for Uber despite city controls prohibiting drug felons driving cabs. Burton was taken into custody on Wednesday on one count of sexual assault and if convicted will face a maximum sentence of 20 years. Uber spokeswoman, Debbee Hancock said on Monday that Burton had passed all the firms background checks before they allowed him to work under their name. However, according to Uber's official background check policy they only review sentences passed down up to seven years ago. That means because Burton was sentence 14-years ago, his drug offense did not register or raise a red flag. Indeed, Burton served 14 years of an 18 year sentence for trying to distribute five kilos or more of cocaine according to the US Bureau of Prisons. That information is readily available online by typing in his name. He was convicted in Houston and served time in Louisana and Georgia before his 2012 release which was commuted because of good behavior. According to Houston regulations someone with a drug conviction is not eligible for a city permit to drive cabs. However, they could appeal and still receive one. Burton did not have a city permit to drive a cab and had never applied for an exemption. Uber has poached Facebook's security chief Joe Sullivan in an attempt to double down on rapidly escalating safety concerns. The $40 billion taxi service has been plagued by serious accusations of failing to vet its drivers. Lawsuits have been brought against Uber in San Francisco and Los Angeles. A New Delhi driver was accused of raping a passenger in December. This week in Denver, a driver tried and failed to break into a passenger's home. And in London, a woman was allegedly asked to perform oral sex on her driver. Lifeline? Joe Sullivan, 46, will leave his role as Facebook's security chief to help Uber defend safety concerns . These claims, among others, follow a data leak last May, which saw the details of 50,000 current and former drivers released into the public domain. It is hoped Sullivan, the first federal prosecutor to specialize in high-technology crime, can protect Uber from potentially crippling ramifications. The firm's first security chief, he brings with him an extensive portfolio of experience in cyber security and privacy. He spent two decades tackling cyber crime security in the private and public sector before joining the Justice Department. Cases included child protection, bank privacy, and digital strands of 9/11 investigations. Since, he has headed up the security departments at eBay, PayPal, and Facebook. Though his experience lies in digital protection, Uber CEO Travis Kalanick has also entrusted the 46-year-old with tackling physical security. Sullivan's role will involve liaising with city and state governments around the world as the firm rapidly expands. Announcing the hire in a blog post on Thursday Kalanick wrote: 'We are both in cyberspace and on city streets all at once; a bridge between bits and atoms. 'And as we get into tens of millions of rides a week, we continue to challenge ourselves to do even better when it comes to safety and data security.' Looking forward: The $40 billion firm's CEO Travis Kalanick announced the news in a blog post on Friday . He added: 'This is a challenge where I get to take what makes Silicon Valley special and apply it to a product that directly impacts people's lives everyday as they move around the world's cities.' There were three high-profile assault cases involving Uber drivers in December 2014. An Indian woman said her driver raped her in New Delhi, leading to outcries and a temporary ban of Uber in that city. It came days after a driver was charged in Boston with raping a young woman. The same week, a woman in London revealed that she was offered £20 credit from Uber after one of its drivers allegedly sexually harassed her during a cab ride. Last week in Denver an UberX driver was arrested after he allegedly dropped a passenger off at the airport before turning around, driving back to her house, and trying to break in. The cities of San Francisco and Los Angeles are both suing the company for 'misleading the public' by failing to conduct thorough backgrounds checks.","Duncan Burton, 57,  was charged last week with rape in Houston, Texas .

The 20-year-old faces a club investigation and potential disciplinary action over his behaviour, and Liverpool manager Rodgers now says he will take time to talk to his rising star about what being a professional entails. Brendan Rodgers will remind Raheem Sterling of his responsibilities after his recent controversies . Liverpool forward  Sterling can be seen pictured on social media whilst smoking a shisha pipe . Rodgers said that Sterling's behaviour would be dealt with internally and that he would be speaking to him . When asked whether he would speak with Sterling, whose opener was followed up by Joe Allen's goal in the 2-0 win at Anfield, Rodgers said: 'I will do. 'I think it’s one where internally we’re always looking into these types of items. 'He’s a young kid that’s been in the spotlight now so he knows the demands of being a top class player and a top class professional, it’s not just on the field it’s off the field but I will speak with him on it and we’ll move on.' An excellent piece of skill from Sterling inside the Newcastle penalty area opened up the chance for him in the ninth minute on Monday night, and the England international expertly curled past goalkeeper Tim Krul to make it 1-0.

Rodgers said that lack of a second goal for Sterling would have left his player disappointed at Anfield . Sterling could have had more goals and at one point shot wide with the goal gaping. Rodgers said that lack of a second finishing touch would have left his player disappointed. 'He’s very valuable, he’s a kid that, he’s non-stop, he wants to learn and improve himself, the Anfield boss said. 'I thought he was outstanding tonight. He’ll be disappointed that he maybe didn’t get three goals this evening, second one he should slot away, but wonderful skill and ability for the first goal and he was tireless all evening pressing the ball and posing a threat.' Sportsmail columnist Jamie Carragher said Sterling would learn from the last six to 12 months at Liverpool . Sportsmail columnist Jamie Carragher said on Sky Sports: 'There’s no doubt over the last six to 12 months, in years to come he’ll look back over this period now as a massive learning curve for him. 'When you’re a 20-year-old kid, you make mistakes at that age, I did, I’m sure we all do. It’s just important that he learns from it because Raheem Sterling, for how good a footballer he is, he needs to be on the back pages, not the front pages and that’s a problem for him in these last few months.'",Raheem Sterling has been videoed allegedly inhaling nitrous oxide .

The Biancoceleste, who have scored 18 goals and conceded just one in their last six Italian league games, will attempt to solidify their grip on second place. A victory would leave them nine points behind Juve with seven games remaining. Lazio, lead by Miroslav Klose and Felipe Anderson, have won eight games in a row in Serie A .

"A family overheard a terrifying message on their young son's baby monitor after the device and its camera were hacked. When the Washington couple's three-year-old had first began complaining of someone talking to him at night, his parents had put it down to their toddler's over-active imagination, reported CBS New York. That was until one night when they heard a strange man's voice come over the monitor to tell their son: 'Wake up little boy, daddy's looking for you.' A couple heard the terrifying message: 'Wake up little boy, daddy's looking for you' come through their 3-year-old son's baby monitor (stock image) And the horrified parents, who do not want to be named for fear the unknown man could track them down, believe it is not just the audio monitor that has been hacked. They believe the stranger has also got into the camera on the device. After the first creepy message, the boy's mother had walked into the room and overheard the hacker saying, 'Look someone's coming' or 'Someone's coming into view.' The mother said she broke down in tears after the realization hit home that a total stranger was able to control the camera to watch their son and spy on them. The stranger had managed to hack the baby monitor and the family says the hacker was even able to remotely control the camera on the monitor (stock image) She told CBS New York: 'Well, I started to cry in there, because it all started coming back to me, and I started figuring things out.' They reported the incident to Foscam, the company where they bought their monitor, who admitted it was possible the device's cameras were being controlled remotely but they could not say from where. Technology experts have now warned that it is becoming easier for hackers to infiltrate family's baby monitors as many of the newer devices connect to the internet. 'It's basically like they're standing next to you in your house,' Lance Ulanoff, chief correspondent for the digital media website Mashable,CBS. He warned that parents should change the passwords on the devices to make it more difficult for people to guess. Because some new baby monitors connect to the internet and come with a smartphone app, it has become easier for hackers to infiltrate them and listen in or speak to children . 'If somebody else has your login information, they can go to that same app, and log into your webcam, which is what happened here,' Ulanoff said. Earlier this month, another couple - this time from Rochester, Minnesota - discovered their baby monitors and cameras had been infiltrated after they found footage from the nanny cam posted online, according to Redbook. They first became suspicious after they heard music coming in from their baby's room. 'We were sleeping in bed, and basically heard music coming from the nursery, but then when we went into the room the music turned off,' she told KTTC. When she tracked down the IP address which was streaming the music, she found a web link to a page with thousands of pictures from baby monitors all over the world, including several from her own child's nursery. 'There's at least fifteen different countries listed and it's not just nurseries—it's people's living rooms, their bedrooms, their kitchens,' she explained. 'Every place that people think is sacred and private in their home is being accessed.'",Washington couple's son began complaining of someone talking to him .

"Pope Francis has angered the Turkish government by describing the mass-murders of up to 1.5million Armenians in 1915 as 'the first . genocide of the 20th century'. The pontiff made the comments at a 100th anniversary Mass on . Sunday, prompting Turkey to summon the Holy See's ambassador in . Ankara in protest. Turkey told the Vatican ambassador it was 'deeply sorry and disappointed' in Pope Francis, adding that his comments had caused a 'problem of trust'. Scroll down for video . Turkey said Pope Francis has caused a 'problem of trust' after describing the mass-murders of up to 1.5million Armenians by Ottoman Turks in 1915 as 'the first genocide of the 20th century' While Turkey accepts that many  Armenians died in . clashes with Ottoman soldiers beginning in 1915, when Armenia . was part of the empire ruled from Istanbul, it denies that the victims reached the estimated 1.5million and that this amounted to genocide. Today was the first time a pope has publicly used  'genocide' to describe the massacre, although it is a term used by many European and South American governments. In 2001, Pope John Paul II and Armenian Apostolic Church . Supreme Patriarch Kerekin II called it 'the first genocide of . the 20th century' in a joint written statement. Francis, who has disregarded many aspects of protocol since . becoming pope two years ago, uttered the phrase during a private . meeting at the Vatican with an Armenian delegation in 2013, . prompting a strong protest from Ankara. As the archbishop of Buenos Aires before becoming the leader . of the world's 1.2 billion Catholics, Jorge Maria Bergoglio had . already publicly characterised the mass killings as genocide. Pope Francis listens as the Patriarch of the Armenian Catholic Church Nerses Bedros XIX Tarmouni speaks during a mass on the 100th anniversary of the Armenian mass killings in St. Peter's Basilica at the Vatican . Mass: Pope Francis greets the Head of Armenia's Orthodox Church Karekin II, during an Armenian-Rite Mass on the occasion of the commemoration of the 100th anniversary of the Armenian Genocide . In memoriam: Prelates take pictures as Pope Francis during the mass in the Vatican today . In November, the Argentine-born pontiff made an official . visit to Turkey as part of his efforts to solidify relations . with moderate Muslim states. This April marks the 100th anniversary of the massacre of an estimated 1.5 million Armenians by Ottoman Turks. The anniversary of the mass killings in World War One will be commemorated by Armenia on April 24. The killings in 1915 are regarded by many historians as the first genocide of the 20th century, and are said to have inspired Nazi leader Adolf Hitler. Armenians say up to 1.5 million of their kin were killed between 1915 and 1917 as the Ottoman Empire was falling apart and have long sought to win international recognition of the massacres as genocide. Turkey rejects the claims, arguing that 300,000 to 500,000 Armenians and as many Turks died in civil strife when Armenians rose up against their Ottoman rulers and sided with invading Russian troops. Several European countries recognize the massacres as such, though Italy and the United States, for example, have avoided using the term officially given the importance they place on Turkey as an ally. Last year, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan issued a message of condolences to descendants of Armenians killed and said Turkey was ready to confront the history of the killings. More recently, Erdogan has accused Armenians of not looking for the truth but seeking to score points against Turkey, saying numerous calls from Turkey for joint research to document precisely what happened had gone unanswered. At the start of the Armenian rite Mass in St. Peter's . Basilica, Pope Francis described the 'senseless slaughter' of . 100 years ago as 'the first genocide of the 20th century', which . was followed by 'Nazism and Stalinism'. 'It is necessary, and indeed a duty, to honour their memory, . for whenever memory fades, it means that evil allows wounds to . fester. Concealing or denying evil is like allowing a wound to . keep bleeding without bandaging it!' he said. Francis's comments were also published by Armenian President . Serzh Sargyan's office on Sunday. 'We are deeply grateful to His Holiness Pope Francis for the . idea of this unprecedented liturgy ... which symbolizes our . solidarity with the people of the Christian world,' Sargyan said . in a speech at a Vatican dinner on Saturday evening. After Francis's remarks on Sunday, Turkey swiftly summoned . the Vatican's ambassador in Ankara to protest and seek an . explanation. 'The pope's statement which is far from historic and legal truths is unacceptable. Religious positions are not places where unfounded claims are made and hatred is stirred,' Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu tweeted. The Foreign Ministry in Ankara later issued a statement conveying its 'great disappointment and sadness.' It said the pope's words signaled a loss in trust, contradicted the pope's message of peace and was discriminatory because Francis only mentioned the pain of Christians, not Muslims or other religious groups. Francis also urged reconciliation between Turkey and . Armenia, and between Armenia and Azerbaijan over the disputed . Caucasus mountain region of Nagorno-Karabakh. The appeal came in . a letter handed out during a meeting after the Mass to Sargyan . and the three most important Armenian church patriarchs present.","Pope calls mass murder of Armenians 'first genocide of the 20th century' The 1915 killings saw 1.5m Armenians slaughtered by Ottoman Turks .

"Robert Kennedy Jr has apologized for describing the number of children injured by vaccines as 'a holocaust'. The nephew of President John F Kennedy used the term last week during the screening of a film that links autism to a chemical found in several childhood vaccinations - despite evidence to the contrary. On Monday, following a storm of criticism, he publicly retracted his statement. Back track: Robert Kennedy Jr has apologized for comparing vaccinated children to holocaust victims . Kennedy said he had been struggling for a way to convey the effects of autism on children and their families. 'I want to apologize to all whom I offended by my use of the word holocaust to describe the autism epidemic,' Kennedy said in a statement. 'I employed the term during an impromptu speech as I struggled to find an expression to convey the catastrophic tragedy of autism which has now destroyed the lives of over 20 million children and shattered their families.' He said he will use other words to describe the autism crisis in the future as he promotes the documentary Trace Amounts. The film purports that there is a connection between thimerosal - a chemical found in several childhood vaccines - and a rise in autism among American children - despite the majority of the scientific community dismissing any connection. Its release comes amid protests against a California bill that would limit vaccination waivers for schoolchildren. Incendiary comment: He made the comment last week while promoting a film that implies there is a link between thimerosal - a chemical used in vaccines - and autism, despite medical evidence to the contrary . It has generated such an acidic debate that some opponents have compared the proposal's author online to Adolf Hitler. State Sen. Richard Pan, a Democratic pediatrician from Sacramento, said he was under added security in response to his bill. The proposal will be heard Wednesday in a Senate education committee. Thursday marks Holocaust Remembrance Day. 'The word holocaust should never be used as a flippant throwaway line to make a point in a debate,' said Assemblyman Marc Levine, vice chair of the Legislative Jewish Caucus, during a Holocaust remembrance event on Monday in the California Assembly.

"Greg Rusedski has supported Aljaz Bedene's bid to overturn an International Tennis Federation ruling and become eligible to represent Great Britain in the Davis Cup. Slovenia-born Bedene secured a British passport last month but cannot currently represent his new nation in the competition having played twice for Slovenia in 2010 and 2011. Bedene's switch in nationality has been met by criticism in some quarters, but not from Rusedski, who himself moved from Canada to represent Great Britain in 1995.

Bedene has Greg Rusedski's support in his bid to overturn the ITF's ruling that he can't play for Great Britain . Rusedski said: 'Every time you get another player in the top 100 it can only be of benefit and I think he will help push and drive other players to get ahead of him. 'At the moment when it comes to the Davis Cup he doesn't even factor into the discussion unless he gets the ITF to overturn their current ruling. 'But I think if the ITF do change their ruling and allow him to become available then it will be a good thing for the game in this country.' Bedene is currently ranked 99 in the world, making him British No 2 behind Andy Murray and ahead of James Ward, Kyle Edmund and Liam Broady.

Murray has already backed Bedene's switch of nationality, saying: 'I would hope that all the guys that are below him now will use it as motivation.' Bedene's case with the ITF is based on the fact that his citizenship was already pending when the governing body amended its own rules on the subject earlier this year.

"A thug who shook a baby girl so violently she was left permanently disabled and died more than a decade later was today jailed for three years for manslaughter. Kealeigh-Anne Woolley was just seven months old when she was left blind, unable to talk and severely brain damaged after being shaken by Colin Heath in January 2000. She spent most of her life in a wheelchair and could only eat through a tube until her death in 2011. Violently shaken: Kealeigh-Anne Woolley, pictured above before the incident, was just seven months old when she was left blind, unable to talk and severely brain damaged after being shaken by Colin Heath . Tragic: The child, pictured with her mother Amanda Woolley in 2001, spent most of her life in a wheelchair . Police arrested Heath, now 43, last September and yesterday he was jailed for three years and two months at Birmingham Crown Court after he admitted manslaughter. The judge, Mr Justice Sir Charles Haddon-Cave, said: 'It is clear that caring for Kealeigh had a profound effect for those who loved and cared for her, particularly her mother who also suffered. 'Kealeigh's mother describes movingly a lifetime of pain and anguish Kealeigh suffered in her [victim impact] statement. 'Her life was turned upside-down in January 2000. Her happy and healthy baby was suddenly disabled. 'The fact that Kealeigh lived as long as she did is a testament to the care and love by those around her. 'Her cause of death is directly attributable to the injury suffered in the care of Mr Heath in January 2000.' Her whole life ahead of her: Kealeigh-Anne, pictured looking healthy before the incident,  was subjected to the violent treatment by her mother's 28-year-old boyfriend at the time, Colin Heath . Worst nightmare: Kealeigh-Anne's mother had been out with her sister when the devastating incident took place. When she returned home later that night she found her daughter unresponsive and floppy . In her victim impact statement, Miss Woolley said: 'Keels would have been 16-years old this year. She should be getting excited for her school prom. She should be here for here for her family. 'You [Heath] took it all away from her. I thank Keels for giving me 11 years, 11 amazing years. I would do anything to have her back here. 'I cannot have her back though as she is gone forever.' Miss Woolley was 20 when she left her daughter with Heath, who she had been in a relationship with for two months, while she went out with her sister Angela on January 16, 2000. When she returned home later that night she found Kealeigh-Anne unresponsive and floppy on the floor of her home in Newcastle-under-Lyme, Staffs. Prosecutor Rachel Brand QC said: 'In January 2000, he [Heath] caused severe brain injuries to Kealeigh-Anne, who had been born on June 22, 1999, and therefore was aged seven months at the time. 'Her death on February 6, 2011, was a direct but delayed consequence of the injuries she suffered in January 2000. There is no dispute about any medical evidence. 'When Amanda Woolley came home late that evening, it was obvious to her that the baby was not well. 'She seemed to have one eye closed and had red marks on her forehead. 'Her neighbour, a mother herself, suggested she did not need to go to hospital.' When Kealeigh-Anne was still pale and floppy the next morning Miss Woolley rushed her to North Staffordshire Hospital where it was discovered that the child had fallen into a coma. Following the incident, she spent months in hospital but was left in a wheelchair, developed epilepsy, cerebral palsy and needed to wear a body cast because her limbs were completely rigid . Damning evidence: Experts compared pictures of Kealeigh-Anne taken on the night Miss Woolley went out and concluded she suffered the injuries while in the care of Heath . Miss Brand added: 'It was clear to the doctors she was in a bad state. She had very severe brain injuries. 'We heard the brain injuries were indicative of non-accidental shaking to which excessive force was used. 'There were excessive bruises on her arms, abdomen and back. 'Doctors were clear that Kealeigh-Anne could not have appeared normal after that severe brain injury was sustained. 'These injuries were life-threatening.' Experts compared pictures of Kealeigh-Anne taken on the night Miss Woolley went out and concluded she suffered the injuries while in the care of Heath. She spent months in hospital but she was left in a wheelchair, developed epilepsy, cerebral palsy and needed to wear a body cast because her limbs were completely rigid. Heath, then aged 28, was jailed for 18 months on December 4, 2000 after admitting child cruelty and causing grievous bodily harm at Stafford Crown Court. But he was re-arrested and charged with manslaughter after Kealeigh-Anne died on February 6, 2011 - almost exactly 11 years after the brutal shaking. Nursing assistant Miss Woolley, now 35, also mother to six-year-old daughter Ellie-Rose, found Kealeigh-Anne lying dead in bed at 9.40pm. Medical experts ruled her death was a direct result of her serious brain injuries sustained in the 2000 attack. Waste of a life: Kealeigh-Anne died in her sleep on Sunday February 6 2011 at the age of 11 . Stuart Muldoon, defending, said: 'This is a tragic case with tragic consequences. 'It was a short-lived shake of the child causing catastrophic injuries and ultimately death. 'Mr Heath had been living quite an active social life. He was a young man. He was 28 years of age at the time of the offence. 'He spent time, as most young men do, going out, frequenting nightclubs and bars. He has isolated himself since. He has been wracked with guilt. 'Nothing that he says and nothing that he does can take us back to that day in January 2000. 'It was an isolated incident and was not to cause violence or to cause cruelty against a small child. There was no intention to kill or cause serious injury. 'He has placed himself in almost complete isolation. His last relationship of any intimacy was back in 2003. He struggles to deal with the enormity of his actions. 'He is remorseful and he is sorry. He will still feel disgust and guilt and shame of what he did to Kealeigh and what impact that it had on her mother and the rest of her family.' Miss Woolley, who attended court yesterday and burst into tears when the sentence was handed down, refused to comment afterwards.","Kealeigh-Anne Woolley was 7 months old when Colin Heath shook her .

"Sexy lingerie brand Frederick's of Hollywood has shut down all of its brick-and-mortar locations, now existing exclusively as an e-commerce brand after years of declining sales and struggling to keep up with Victoria's Secret. The Los Angeles-based company has switched to a web-only retail model following the closure of all of its 94 locations, with the brand now encouraging customers to shop online,The Los Angeles Times reported on Thursday. 'We no longer have store locations,' reads the brand's website, which goes on to note that the online store offers the same selection of products. Scroll down for video . New look: Frederick's of Hollywood, which is known for its sexy lingerie (pictured), has closed all of its brick-and-mortar locations . Making it work: The retailer announced on it's website that it 'no longer' has store locations while reminding customers that its 'online store offers the same selection of products' 'As a company, I think they became old and stale,' Ron Friedman, a retail expert at consulting and accounting firm Marcum, told The Los Angeles Times. 'Victoria's Secret has been a home run compared to them.' But Mr Friedman went on to say that Frederick's of Hollywood Group Inc. can still be successful with careful corporate strategy. 'They have to really focus and hire people that really understand the online business,' he noted. Founder Frederick Mellinger opened the pinup-inspired lingerie brand's first store in Los Angeles in 1947 and went on to launch a mail order catalog in the 1960s, later adding sex toys and more risqué attire to the company's offerings. Mr Mellinger, who famously said 'sex appeal is always in style', died in 1990 at the age of 76. A decade later in 2000, his namesake company, which once had pin-up icon Bettie Page modeling its lingerie, declared bankruptcy. After emerging from bankruptcy in 2003, the company went public in 2006. Party's over: The Frederick's of Hollywood store pictured was one of the 94 locations that have been closed . Celebrity fans: Actress Sofia Vergara (R) recently revealed that she used to buy bras for her size 32F breasts at Frederick's of Hollywwood, while Blurred Lines dancer Emily Ratajkowski has modeled for the lingerie retailer . Star power: Emily, 23, can be seen posing in a black corset for the sexy lingerie retailer . Two years ago the struggling brand was purchased by a consortium that includes HGI Funding, a subsidiary of New York-based Harbinger Group Inc., and some of its own shareholders. While Frederick's of Hollywood has changed the way it does business, one A-list celebrity has recently been reminiscing about her relationship with the brand. Modern Family star Sofia Vergara, 42, told Vanity Fair that her size 32F breasts and tiny frame make it nearly impossible to find lingerie, so she used to frequently shop at the store when she first got her start. 'My boobs are, like, huge,' she said in the May issue of the magazine. 'My whole life, buying a bra was a nightmare. What I used to do when I moved to LA, I found places like Frederick's of Hollywood that make bras for streetwalkers ... I can't think of the word ... you know... dancers... strippers.

Brady spent the rest of his life in a wheelchair, advocating against gun violence. He died in August. Sarah Brady was also involved in gun violence prevention for the past 30 years. She was the chairwoman of the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence and the Brady Center to Prevent Gun Violence from 2000 until she died. The National Rifle Association said its thoughts and prayers were with the Brady family. ""Although we disagreed on public policy, Sarah Brady was an honorable American who we always respected,"" the gun rights organization said. People we've lost in 2015 . On the Brady Campaign's website, she said she got involved in gun control after her young son picked up what she thought was a toy gun on the seat of a friend's pickup. Her son started to wave it around and she took it from him. It was not a toy, she said, and she fumed over what she imagined could have happened. The loaded gun was much like the one used to shoot her husband. ""It just hit me like a ton of bricks,"" she told CNN in 2013. ""So I asked Jim if he felt comfortable with me speaking out, and he said, 'Of course.'"" After that, the Bradys made it their business to be gun control activists. Despite budgets that were just a fraction of the gun lobby's, the Bradys and their colleagues helped pass federal and state laws, including Maryland's 1988 ban on cheap handguns known as Saturday night specials, 1993's Brady law requiring background checks on certain kinds of gun purchases and a ban on manufacturing and future sales of some military-style firearms, which lasted from 1994 to 2004. Read Sarah Brady's 2014 op-ed for CNN.com . Former President Bill Clinton, who signed the Brady bill in 1993, and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said in a joint statement Saturday that the Bradys ""were fierce champions of sensible gun legislation."" Sarah Brady ""transformed tragedy into a courageous campaign, and because of her work and her remarkable life, American families are safer today,"" the Clintons said. Brady Campaign and Center President Dan Gross said in a written statement that few people are responsible for saving as many lives as Sarah and James Brady. ""Our nation has lost a great hero, and I have lost a dear friend,"" he said. ""I am certain that she would want nothing more than to know we are carrying on her and Jim's legacy with the same fiery compassion and dedication that made her so remarkable."" Sen Charles Schumer, a New York Democrat who helped write the Brady bill, concurred. ""She was strong and forceful, sweet and kind, and someone I considered a friend and patriot for decades,"" he said. ""She was a true hero and will be missed by America."" James Brady was one of four people wounded in Reagan's shooting outside a Washington hotel. Suffering a head wound, it was erroneously reported at one point that Brady had died. He was, however, left partially paralyzed. Reagan, severely wounded as well, also survived the attack and served two terms as President. Hinckley was found not guilty by reason of insanity in the shooting and has spent the ensuing years in a psychiatric hospital. The Brady bill was fiercely fought over for seven years before Congress approved it and President Bill Clinton signed it into law in 1993.

"Kanye West has revealed that he is sick of the notion that celebrities are controlling society as members of the secret group The Illuminati, in an essay that he penned for Paper magazine's American Dream issue. Less than a year after his wife Kim Kardashian posed nude for the magazine, the 37-year-old rapper stars on Paper's latest cover, donning a grey sweatshirt from his collection for Adidas and a necklace featuring his daughter North's nickname, Nori. In the April issue, Kanye explained his 'world dream' and noted that if there was an actual Illuminati, 'it would be more like the energy companies' - not Hollywood stars. 'I am tired of people pinpointing musicians as the Illuminati. That's ridiculous,' he said. 'We don’t run anything; we’re celebrities. We’re the face of brands.' Scroll down for video . American icon: Kanye West covers Paper magazine's April issue - less than a year after his wife Kim Kardashian posed nude for the glossy . Close up: Kanye penned an essay for the magazine, in which he discussed his 'world dream' After it was announced last month that Kanye, Madonna, Beyonce and other famous musicians were all co-owners of Jay Z’s new Tidal streaming service, rumors began to swirl online that everyone involved in the project is a member of the the top-secret Illuminati, but Kanye noted that musicians don't have that kind of power. He explained that celebrities don't even get the freedom to say and do exactly what they want, let alone 'run anything': 'We have to compromise what we say in lyrics so we don’t lose money on a contract. 'Madonna is in her 50s and gave everything she had to go up on an award show and get choked by her cape,' Kanye added, referencing Madonna's recent fall at the Brit Awards in February. He went on to say that the 56-year-old legend even gets 'judged for who she adopts', adding: 'F*** all of this sensationalism.' On the subject of children, the rapper said we should be thankful that we can raise kids, before noting that we should be trying to bring them up in a 'truthful world', not one that is 'based on brand and concepts of perception'. Star style: The 37-year-old rapper modeled a Kanye West x Adidas Originals shirt and vintage military pants for the photoshoot . Proud dad: The father also wore a necklace featuring his daughter North's nickname, Nori . Sunny day: Kanye put his had down as he posed in a field of wildflowers . 'When I look in North’s eyes, I’m happy about every mistake I’ve ever made,' the father-of-one said. 'I’m happy that I fought to bring some type of reality to this world we choose to stay in right now, driven by brands and corporations.' In addition to striving to bring reality to the world, Kanye said that he is a proponent of people following their dreams, advocating that a 'little self-belief can go a long way'. 'I think the scariest thing about me is the fact that I just believe,' he said. 'I believe awesome is possible and I believe that beauty is important.' And while Kanye said that beauty is 'undermined by our current corporate culture', he added that he also sees money as something that is 'equally important' - even though 'artists have been brainwashed to look at it as a bad thing'. Mentoring younger artists, such as Drake, A$AP Rocky, Kendrick Lamar and Taylor Swift, is of the utmost importance to Kanye because he said it will help 'make better music in the future'. Turn around: The musician was also photographed with his back to the camera . True artist: Kanye showed his Kanye West x Adidas Originals Fall 2015 collection (pictured) at New York Fashion Week in February . Fatherly love: Kanye said that when he looks into his daughter North's eyes (pictured) he is 'happy about every mistake' he has ever made . 'It’s funny that I worked at the Gap in high school, because in my past 15 years it seems like that’s the place I stood in my creative path -  to be the gap, the bridge,' he said. Kanye also candidly discussed the fashion industry, saying that while he was grateful that his collection for Adidas - which was shown at New York Fashion Week in February - was 'accepted positively', he found an article that asked: ''Should Kanye leave fashion to the professionals?' to be posing an 'ignorant' question. 'The second I sell my first T-shirt or my first shoe, doesn’t that make me a professional?' he asked before saying he finds it 'funny to be so famous and noted for one thing, and to have so many people try to box you out of another form of art.' When it comes to his love of fashion, Kanye explained he wants to be as close to as a kid as possible, because when children say that they like something, they aren't looking for a 'thumbs up' or a 'thumbs down', they are just sharing their admiration. 'Fashion is something that’s in my heart to do - in my spirit,' he said. 'There’s no world that can stop me from what I love. Not the rap world, not the fashion world, not the real world.'

"It’s that time of year when the English challenge in Europe fades in the face of overwhelming firepower and the thorny issue of the salary cap re-surfaces. This time, Dai Young has sounded the annual alarm. Wasps’ director of rugby could not have asked much more from his gallant side as they pushed Toulon all the way before losing their Champions Cup quarter-final at Stade Felix Mayol on Sunday. Yet, the scale of what they were up against was illustrated by the sight of Matt Giteau and Juan Fernandez Lobbe – two of the world’s finest players – coming on as replacements for the hosts. A pair of Springboks, Bryan Habana and Juan Smith, were among a glittering non-playing contingent. Wasps coach Dai Young has called for reform to the Premiership salary cap so English clubs can compete on the European stage - the comments came after his team lost 32-18 to Toulon on Sunday . Lozowski makes a diving pass while his ankle is grasped by the Toulon player on the ground . Toulon's English speedster Delon Armitage makes a break for the defending champions . CLERMONT v SARACENS, Stade Geoffroy-Guichard, St Etienne, Saturday, April 18, 3.15pm (GMT) TOULON v LEINSTER, Stade Vélodrome, Marseille, Sunday,     April 19, 3.15pm (GMT) Young quipped that the absence of Leigh Halfpenny from the Toulon ranks meant that Wasps only had ‘about five world-class full-backs to worry about’. The joke hinted at a more serious point; the personnel gulf between the wealthy French elite and their Premiership rivals. The English clubs simply can’t compete when the leading Top 14 sides play to their potential, due to the disparity in budgets. Yet again, the salary cap — currently £5.5million — is back on the agenda. ‘There are pros and cons for everything,’ said Young. ‘The salary cap has worked; all the clubs have been sustainable for a long period, it’s the most competitive league in Europe and there have been two or three different title winners in the last few seasons, too. Wasps' No 10 Alex Lozowski kicks away from Michalak during their European Champions Cup quarter-final . Toulon playmaker Frederic Michalak pulls the strings for the defending European champions . ‘It has also meant a lot of young English players are getting exposure at that level, so it has done what it was intended to do. But maybe we need a a re-think about how important Europe is to the English teams and how the salary cap leaves us when playing against the big French teams. ‘Realistically, Premiership teams need a bit of luck to arrive at these games with their best team fit. With the salary cap, there’s no way we can match the massive squads these clubs have.’ Wasps couldn’t match Toulon’s depth of playing resources, but they did trouble the holders thanks to the dynamic efforts of two young Englishmen — centre Elliot Daly and scrum-half Joe Simpson. Their electric running maintained the form Young believes should put them in contention for a place in England’s World Cup squad. ‘I don’t know what more they can do,’ said the Welshman. ‘If England want to win the World Cup, these are the type of players you have to get in your team.’ New Zealander Williams rises to celebrate his try which came minutes after he should have been sin-binned . Ali Williams crosses for a late try for Toulon as they put victory over Wasps on Sunday beyond doubt .",Dai Young wants to reform the current salary cap in English top flight .

"A man has been jailed after fathering a child with his own daughter who he raped repeatedly from when she was aged just 10 (file image) A man has been jailed for life after fathering a child with his own daughter who he raped repeatedly from when she was just 10. The man, who cannot be named for legal reasons, was given a life sentence after Derby Crown Court after jurors heard how he 'took his daughter's life' through sexual abuse. His depravity was exposed when he impregnated her when she was just a teenager, having 'poisoned' the girl against her mother. As she watched her abuser being led away from the dock the girl ran towards him, crying out: 'I love you and miss you.' Earlier the court heard how her father had been her primary carer for years and began raping her when he felt 'out of sorts or angry'. Despite promising to stop the abuse after each attack, the man carried on abusing her until she became pregnant. In a bid to terminate the pregnancy without raising concern he encouraged his daughter to continue kick boxing, the court heard. Eventually, when the girl refused to tell authorities who the father of the baby was they ordered a paternity test. The pair fled but were apprehended by police and the man taken into custody. Giving evidence the girl told of how she was too scared to reported her father to police and still 'loved him'. 'The abuse has set my life on the wrong course and destroyed the normal childhood and teenage years that everyone deserves,' she said in a statement. 'I feared the consequences of disclosure because I love my dad. 'I know what he did was wrong, but I grew up with my dad by my side. 'I just wanted him to get help to make him better but unfortunately that never happened and it has come to this. 'It's come to me having a baby and to the father being my dad and to him being sentenced and my life falling apart.' The man, who earlier admitted rape, had 'poisoned' the girl against her mother who did not live with them, the court heard. Applying the same sentence as is handed to murderers, Judge Stuart Rafferty QC told the man: 'You took your daughter's life.' Jailing him for a minimum term of 15 years, he said: 'It's difficult to find words that could properly describe the extent of your deprivation and the damage that that deprivation has caused, not to a stranger but to your own daughter. 'Children do not ask to be born. Children are entitled to expect the best from their parents, in terms of care and parental love, that they can possibly receive. 'You gave your daughter a warped variation of that, a variation that suited you, not her. 'And, although I know you have to serve a prison sentence for that, the sentence you imposed upon her is a far greater one.' He added the girl has been consigned 'to a life of darkness'. 'She loved you, as any child loves its parents, and although people may think it strange, she loves you still - that's what children do.' The man was sentenced to life imprisonment at Derby Crown Court (above). His daughter cried: 'I love you' as he was led way from the dock .",Man raped his daughter repeatedly over four years from when she was 10 .

"John Helm was commentating on Bradford City’s game against Lincoln City when the fire broke out and still struggles to listen to his description of that fatal day. Here he gives his insight into what caused the blaze. It was a day I have often tried to forget, but it was the one I must always remember. Approaching the 30th anniversary of the Bradford City fire, it was inevitable I would be asked to recall the horrific images from a match I was commentating on for Yorkshire Television. What I did not expect was for someone to suggest the fire may not have been an accident, as Martin Fletcher has done with his book Fifty-Six, the Story of the Bradford Fire. The tragic fire at Bradford City's Valley Parade stadium claimed 56 victims and injured 265 on May 11, 1985 . Martin lost three generations of his family and has a right to speak his mind — any bitterness would be understandable — but from everything I have been told there isn’t a jot of evidence to suggest the blaze was caused deliberately. On the contrary, I remember the coroner telling me it was obvious how the fire had started. Detective Inspector Raymond Falconer actually identified a man who had dropped a lit cigarette that went down a hole in the stand and started the fire. This corroborates what I was told at the time by the coroner. He said it was believed the fire had been started by a man, visiting this country from Australia, but his name was never revealed. Without making allegations against the club’s chairman at the time Stafford Heginbotham, there is inference by implication in the book — with reference to a series of fires at factories owned by the now deceased Heginbotham. As members of his own family were seated in the stand that day, and as it was due to be demolished anyway 48 hours later, it is unfathomable to think there could have been an act of arson. I find it abhorrent that Stafford Heginbotham’s family are being subjected to this unseemly inference at a time when people are still grieving and paying their respects three decades on from the most horrendous day of their lives. There isn’t a shred of evidence to suggest anything other than a terrible human tragedy. It should also never be forgotten that Heginbotham twice saved Bradford City from extinction. As son James said to me: ‘He put that club above everything else, including family and business.’ A memorial at Valley Parade pays tribute those who died  in the devastating blaze almost 30 years ago . We all have our memories of a day that still sends a shudder up my spine. I cannot bear to watch the footage. If I hear my voice describing the tragedy as it unfolded I have to leave the room. Many of the 54 Bradford and two Lincoln fans who lost their lives, choked to death with inhalation of fumes. The smell was of acrid tar. As a Bradfordian myself I knew many of those fleeing for their lives, as I attempted to describe the scenes without becoming over-emotional. Thirty years on we try to forget but we must always remember. Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","John Helm was commentating on the game the day the fire broke out .

"Nairobi, Kenya (CNN)Kenyan Deputy President William Ruto on Saturday gave the United Nations' refugee agency three months to relocate refugees from the Dadaab camp -- the world's largest -- to Somalia, or ""we shall relocate them ourselves."" ""The way America changed after 9/11 is the way Kenya will change after Garissa,"" Ruto said in Nyeri, according to a statement from his office. Al-Shabaab gunmen stormed Garissa University College in eastern Kenya this month, killing 147 people. Kenya's government says that attack was masterminded by senior Al-Shabaab leader Mohamed Mohamud, whose ""extensive terrorist network within Kenya"" extends into the sprawling Dadaab complex, according to a Kenyan government document given to CNN. Students wake to Islamist militants' terror . Ruto, who is the second highest-ranking person in Kenya's government behind President Uhuru Kenyatta, said his government has had discussions with United Nations officials about what to do with the camp. On Saturday, a U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees officer said the agency had not received any formal request from Kenya's government about moving Dadaab. The U.N. refugee agency manages the Dadaab complex, having set up the first camps there in late 1991 amid Somalia's civil war. The agency and the governments of both Kenya and Somalia agreed in 2013 on a process for the repatriation of Somali refugees. But that was supposed to be mutually agreed-upon and voluntary, in accordance with the refugees' ""freely expressed wish and their relevant knowledge of the conditions"" where they'd end up, according to the pact. None of those things, it seems, applies now to the move pushed by Ruto on Saturday. It's not clear where he expects the refugees to go, other than somewhere into Somalia and out of Kenya. Any mass move would be a monumental task, disrupting the already difficult lives of more than 600,000 Somalis who call the camp their home. Simply meeting basic needs is a challenge in the vast complex, which has seen devastating droughts, contagious diseases and other travails that have tested its residents and those trying to help. Still, as tough as conditions there are, they are seen as a better alternative to life back in Somalia, where Al-Shabaab is based and has carried out violent attacks for years. Yet the Islamist extremist group hasn't confined its terror to its homeland, as illustrated by the Garissa attack and the 2013 siege of Nairobi's upscale Westgate Mall, which ended with at least 67 dead. The Dadaab complex came under government scrutiny after the Westgate Mall attack, too. But just a few weeks later, CNN's Nima Elbagir managed to go from Somalia to the Dadaab refugee camp undetected by taking one of the panya, or ""rat routes,"" just like many others have done, Al-Shabaab sympathizers among them. Such illicit travel along porous borders as well as police officers' willful ignorance of migrants' fake IDs, as acknowledged by then-Interior Minister Ole Lemku, illustrates Kenya's challenge in keeping out threats from Somalia. That's why, in addition to moving the Dadaab camp, Kenya is building of a 435-mile (700-kilometer) wall covering most of the Somali border from Mandera to Kiunga -- a wall that Ruto says has begun to prevent Al-Shabaab elements from getting into Kenya. The deputy president also vowed that any businesses collaborating with the militant group will be shut down. These measures are in addition to Kenyan airstrikes on Al-Shabaab camps in Somalia in the days after the Garissa massacre. ""We must secure this country at whatever cost, even if we lose business with Somalia,"" Ruto said Saturday. ""No politics, no games, no half-measures should apply, as the death of the 147 students must touch all Kenyans."" CNN's Lillian Leposo reported from Nairobi, and CNN's Greg Botelho reported and wrote this story from Atlanta.","The Dadaab refugee camp is the world's largest, with more than 600,000 people .

"A year after he launched his own app and made headlines, Leo Grand is still homeless . On the night he launched his first app, a homeless man predicted that his life was going to change. 'I can work at Google, I can work at SpaceX,' Leo Grand gleefully stated minutes after his carpooling app Trees for Cars went live. 'This will change my life in a magnificent way.' It's been a year and a half since that moment led to Grand and his mentor, Patrick McConlogue, becoming media sensations. But Trees for Cars is no longer available, and Grand is still homeless, Mashable reported. In August 2013 McConlogue offered Grand, the homeless man he saw every day on his walk to work in New York City, a deal: He would either give him $100, or he would teach him how to code. Grand realized he could go through '$100 in a few days' and instead jumped at the opportunity to learn something new that he could then 'turn into something more,' he told Business Insider in 2013. McConlogue provided Grand with daily lessons, as well as a laptop, wireless hot spot, coding books, a solar charger and office space at the start-up where he worked once it got too cold to type outside. Grand, who once said he wasn't 'the average homeless person' and that he considered himself 'eco-friendly', came up with an app designed to get more cars off the road. 'When I first launched my app it was good,' Grand told Mashable this week. 'I was excited, the press was excited, it was just a great moment.' Grand and McConlogue appeared on TV shows, and he says people loved him everywhere and gave him free coffee at restaurants. Being on NBC, he said, was the highlight of his year. 'We got to stay in a nice hotel at Rockefeller Plaza. A nice, swanky hotel. We got the red carpet rolled out in front of us!' he said. But Grand is still living on the streets, and he said the number one question people ask him is why he's still homeless. Grand created Trees and Cars after Patrick McConlogue offered him a deal: $100 in cash on the spot or daily coding lessons. Grand picked the latter, and was also provided a laptop, office space and coding books . But Grand is still living on the streets. He said the number one question people ask him is why he's still homeless . Trees for Cars only made Grand between $10,000 to 15,000 dollars, he said. And McConlogue has since taken a job in San Francisco, although he still meets up with Grand every time he's back in New York. The app is no longer in online stores because Grand does not want to pay for its server space. Grand instead uses the money he made from the app to pay for his storage space. He also keeps some possessions in a shopping cart. He insists that he likes living outdoors, although he said he plans to move into an apartment after he makes his second app. Grand said if he could do it all over again, he would have made a different app the first time around. 'I would've probably come up with a better idea for a mobile application that can generate a ton of revenue,' he told Mashable. For now, Grand said he does not code everyday anymore. He said 'life' is the reason for that. 'I've got the books, I've got the laptop, I've got the office space. I just haven't been able to get over there recently.' Grand, who gets by with welding jobs and worked for MetLife until he lost his job in 2011, once said the most hurtful thing someone could say to him was that he was dumb or not intelligent. 'Homelessness is not a feature of someone or a condition,' McConlogue said. 'It is something that people put a lot of people - in a lot of different situations - into one giant box.' Grand said if he could do it all over again, he would have 'come up with a better ideal' that would have generated more revenue. He said he only made around $10-15,000 with Trees for Cars .","Leo Grand was offered a deal: either $100 or lessons in coding from Patrick McConlogue, who passed him on the street every day .

"Sprinkles the 33-pound cat is so fat she can't even roll over and she's comparatively as obese as a 700-pound human, say rescue workers. The neglected cat from Sea Isle City in New Jersey was handed over to the rescue agency S.O.S Sea Isle Cats by a family facing a foreclosure on their home. Luckily for Sprinkles who is too fat to even groom herself, she is being cared for by pet rescue volunteer Stacy Jones Olandt. Fat cat: Sprinkles the 33-pound cat is so fat she can't even roll over and she's equally as fat as a 700-pound human, say rescue workers . 'Whatever position she’s in, she’s stuck. She can barely move,' said Olandt, a helper at the non-profit S.O.S. Sea Isle City Cats. When coming to collect Sprinkles, the volunteers at S.O.S were unable to carry her. They had to put her in a crate and get a man to carry her up the stairs, reports Press of Atlantic City. 'We’re a bunch of old ladies. We had to get a young man to get her up the steps,' said Olandt. Sprinkles is a four-year-old spotted black and white cat who won the affection of the women working at S.O.S. Not only is Sprinkles overweight but when she was rescues she had an awful flea infestation, ear mites, and an ear infection. A healthy weight for Sprinkles would be 10 pounds which is 20 pounds less than she currently weighs. Olandt said that Sprinkles heavy weight can be compared to a person weighing 700 pounds. New hope: Cat rescuer Stacy Olandt, of Sea Isle City, plays with Sprinkles, a 33-pound female domestic short-haired cat on Thursday following her rescue . 'We’ve seen fat cats at 20 to 25 pounds but this is just obscene. Cats, by and large, don’t overfeed themselves. This is similar to a 600 or 700 pound human that should weigh 180 pounds,' said Olandt. Luckily for Sprinkles, she is expected to survive. Her fleas and mites are gone and her ear infection is being treated with antibiotics. She will hopefully lose a pound a month after being placed on a special diet. The next move is to find Sprinkles a loving home. 'She’s sweet, sweet, sweet. I’ve never seen so many people broken-hearted and hopeful at the same time,' said Olandt. Olandt told Phillymag.com that Sprinkles has a beautiful face, 'like a pretty fat girl.' 'She's letting us clean the red, raw spots, and she's so sweet. The lovingest, most precious cat. She's happy now. And she has a beautiful face, which I guess is what they say about fat girls,' said Olandt. She also said that when Sprinkles loses the weight she will need a tummy tuck so that her skin doesn't drag on the floor. Those who wish to adopt Sprinkles the cat can apply here.","Sprinkles the 33-pound cat is so fat she can't even roll over and she's equally as fat as a 700-pound human, say rescue workers .

"Under pressure Bayern Munich manager Pep Guardiola has revealed that 'only the treble is enough' for his team as they attempt to overturn their 3-1 deficit against Porto in the Champions League. Bayern host the Portuguese side on Tuesday and Guardiola is confident the Bundesliga leaders will emerge victorious. 'I am completely convinced that my players will take their chances,' Guardiola said. 'I know which club I am at and know that (league) champions and cup winners is not enough. Only the treble is enough.' Pep Guardiola is targeting winning  three trophies with Bayern Munich this season .

Philipp Lahm will look to lead his team into the semi-final of the Champions League on Tuesday . Bayern remain on course for three trophies, leading the Bundesliga by 12 points and will meet Borussia Dortmund in the German Cup semi-final. The Bavarians won the treble under then coach Jupp Heynckes in 2013, just before Guardiola took over. The current Bayern boss also won the treble with Barcelona in 2009, when they became the first Spanish club to win the domestic league and cup as well as the Champions League in the same season. Ahead of the visit of Porto, Guardiola said on Monday that France winger Franck Ribery is highly unlikely to recover from an ankle injury in time to feature for Bayern. Ribery has been out for more than a month and Guardiola said it was more likely the player would miss the second leg of the quarter-final in Munich as the Germans look to recover from a stunning 3-1 defeat in Portugal last week. 'I do not think that Franck can play,' Guardiola told reporters. 'I will speak with the our doctor but my feeling is that he can't make it.' Guardiola's hopes of turning the tie around have been hampered by a string of injury absences, including to key players Arjen Robben, David Alaba, Javi Martinez and Medhi Benatia. Bastian Schweinsteiger is also fighting to get fit in time for the game and Guardiola said the Germany captain would train with the team late on Monday for the first time. 'I do not know who will play or who can play. In the past months, I always decided on my lineup an hour before the game.'

'Bastian Schweinsteiger will today train again for the first time and the more players I have the better,' Guardiola added. The Spaniard, who wore a T-shirt made by the family of an Argentine journalist killed in a car crash at last year's World Cup, said his team would try everything to overturn the first leg deficit despite the injury problems. 'It makes no sense to be on the pitch if you don't want to turn it around. We want to turn it around,' he said.",Porto beat Bayern Munich 3-1 in Champions League quarter-final first leg .

"Nigel Farage is a 'Victor Meldrew in stilts' whose remarks about immigrants and ethnic minorities reveal the 'truly odious nature of his views', Nick Clegg claimed today in an extraordinary attack on the UKIP leader. In an interview with MailOnline, Mr Clegg said Mr Farage's 'mask is slipping' to reveal a man uncomfortable talking about people who are not white 'lashing out' in a scrabble for headlines. The Lib Dem leader condemned David Cameron's appeal to UKIP supporters to 'come home', warning the 'bandwagons of the far right' are encircling an 'increasingly hapless Conservative leadership' which is losing all grip on the party. Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg claimed Nigel Farage's 'mask is slipping' to reveal a man uncomfortable talking about people who are not white 'lashing out' in a scrabble for headlines . Mr Cameron issued an appeal to people planning to vote UKIP to instead support the Tories in an attempt to block a 'toxic tie-up' between Laabiur and the SNP. But Mr Clegg condemned the 'worrying' suggestion that his former coalition partners should seek to build a majority by appealing to people on the 'far right'. Speaking in his bright yellow campaign bus as he headed to the South West, Mr Clegg: . Mr Farage has courted controversy throughout the election campaign, in an apparent attempt to generate headlines and shore up Ukip's core vote. He was condemned in the first TV leaders' debate for saying people with HIV should not be allowed into Britain and in the second for attacking the audience for being too left-wing. After criticism that the Ukip manifesto featured almost all white faces, he insisted yesterday that there was a 'half black' party spokesman featured prominently - and 'one fully black person'. The Lib Dem leader told MailOnline's political editor Matt Chorley that the 'bandwagons of the far right' are encircling an 'increasingly hapless Conservative leadership' Miriam González Durantezhas been writing a food blog . Nick Clegg is such a bad cook his wife Miriam only lets him do the washing up. The Lib Dem leader admitted his 'rubbishness' in the kitchen after it emerged his wife and sons had been secretly running a food blog - MumAndSons - posting recipes and photographs online. Mr Clegg said he had played no part in the culinary operation, but had helped with taking pictures for the blog: 'I'm sure you can see my hand in a couple of them.' But his own cooking abilities do not stretch to more than peanut butter on toast. 'I'm a sort of sous chef, Mr Clegg told MailOnline. 'I provide helpful moral backing and assistance. I'll do the washing up, and tasting and preparatory tasks.' Asked if there was nothing he could cook, Mr Clegg replied: 'I'm sure I could but I'm great eater, I'm just really not a very good cook. 'If I had to, if I was starving... Peanut butter on white toast obviously, with jam on top. I'm seriously into jam on top.' Ms Gonzalez Durantez said she had run a cooking blog with her children  for three years . Mr Clegg said the comments revealed Mr Farage's true nature: 'The mask is slipping. I think the more he thrashes around to get attention the more the mask slips and the truly odious nature of his views become more and more obvious. 'This is someone who is clearly uncomfortable talking about people from different ethnic backgrounds, calls them 'half' and 'fully' black, but is also someone who advocates basically turning our backs on people who are very sick and kind of indulging in a language that is so divisive, so odious.' Mr Clegg, who boasts that the Lib Dems will win many, many more seats than UKIP on May 7, accused Mr Farage of 'running a truly incompetent campaign'. 'He is just lashing around, thrashing around, lurching from one odious gaffe or assertion to the next. There is no pattern. 'One moment he claims he wants to take his manifesto seriously and the next he is talking about fully and half black candidates. 'You are either serious or a kind of Victor Meldrew on stilts. Which one are you? 'It just beggars belief that it is that kind of person that the Conservative party thinks they need to bring back into the fold.' He said Mr Cameron's appeal to Ukip voters 'could not have been more explicit - people like Farage, please come back home'. 'I don't think the Conservative should have a home for those kind of views,' he added. Mr Clegg, who visited the Airbus HQ in Filton, Bristol before travelling to Wales, said he would use the final 15 days of the campaign to tell voters of the 'danger of these kind of really odious views basically taking over or encroaching upon how a mainstream party like the Conservative party thinks and acts'. He warned that without the Lib Dems back in coalition, the Tories would be dragged to the 'extremes' by right wing backbenchers, Ukip and the DUP. He said that it is a 'tragedy' that a centrist politician like Mr Cameron had lost control of his party. 'What's happening is you are seeing the bandwagons of the far right encircling an increasingly hapless Conservative leadership. 'And the Conservative leadership will become just victim to and puppets of an array of hardline right wing voices from UKip, from DUP, from their own backbenches, which will do huge damage to our country. Huge damage. Mr Clegg, who visited the Airbus factory in Filton, Bristol today, said the Lib Dems would act as a 'bulwark' against the Tories lurching to the right . Mr Clegg claimed right wing Tories want to 'enter into coalition with Ukip, some of them want to bring back the death penalty, they want to ban the burka' Mr Farage - appearing on ITV's Lorraine this morning - has courted controversy throughout the election campaign, sparking accusations from Mr Clegg today that he was an 'odious Victor Meldrew' (pictured right) Mr Clegg claimed right wing Tories want to 'enter into coalition with Ukip, some of them want to bring back the death penalty, they want to ban the burka'. 'They have got very hardline views on people who need help from the state because they have fallen on hard times,' Mr Clegg said. 'And they take this very ideological view that basically the state and support for public services should be remorselessly cut back and cut back and cut back and cut back for no reason other than some kind of hardline ideological preference for it.' Mr Clegg went head to head with Mr Farage in two TV debates last year, ahead of the European Parliament elections, which UKip went on to win while the Lib Dems lost all but one seat in Brussels. Mr Clegg insisted most people in Britain are 'decent and pragmatic', and that the Lib Dems are most 'in tune' with public opinion. But he admitted he faces a 'challenge' to turn that into votes after a devastating collapse in popularity since entering coalition five years ago. We're the guarantee that will not let the swivel-eyed brigade take over. He added: 'We are the only bulwark, we are the only barrier, we are the only dam against this increasing pressure from people with some very, very nasty views which would lead to ideologically imposed cuts on nurseries, on schools on colleges.' David Cameron came under fire from Mr Clegg as he visited Advantage children's daycare nursery in Surbiton with London Mayor Boris Johnson . Mr Clegg said he defended Mr Farage's right to say controversial things in an open democracy, but hoped they would be defeated on Election Day. 'I really really abhor what Farage stands for but I don't begrudge the right to say what he says and seek to represent those views in Parliament. 'What worries me much more is not whether he gets a number of MPs in the House of Commons, those seats then become the tail that wags the Tory dog. 'Democracy should be able to encompass views that I would find absolutely beyond the pale, that's what being a free country is about. 'It's about disagreeing with those views, taking them on, arguing against them and defeating them in an argument. 'It's not about saying they shouldn't be expressed. That would be very illiberal.' A Ukip spokesman said: 'This smacks of desperation from a Clegg, horrified by his disastrous polls, trying to punch above his weight. If only he'd do it with policy, rather than these venting, personal attacks. A trick he has obviously learned from Mr Cameron.'","EXCLUSIVE Nick Clegg warns the Ukip leader's 'mask is slipping' Condemns Farage for comments on migrants and 'half black' candidates .

"Bernie Madoff allegedly tried to persuade his drug dealer's girlfriend to become his mistress . Bernie Madoff, who carried out one of the world's largest frauds, tried to persuade his drug dealer's girlfriend to become his mistress, it has emerged. Madoff is serving 150 years in prison for carrying out a $65 billion Ponzi style fraud - which became the largest in financial history. A new book about the financier claims he had put pressure on an Israeli model who was working for him as a stock analyst and dating his dealer Silvio Eboli to sleep with him. He is said to have met Eboli at a Christmas party in 1997 at the Montauk Yacht Club with his son Mark, who later committed suicide over his father's fraudulent activities, Page Six reported. 'Bernie had put enormous pressure on 'Leah' to sleep with him and be his mistress, offering her practically anything if she just let him f*** her,' the book by Toby Rogers states. Eboli is believed to have never confronted Madoff but warned he would injure him if he ever crossed the line with his girlfriend. After 'Leah' became pregnant with Eboli's child in 2001 Madoff apparently summoned her into his office to say she had made a mistake. In the book Madoff is described as bellowing 'You could have had gold. You could have had me. You could have had an apartment, a car, a driver. But instead you throw all that away for some f****** hippie!' Madoff was arrested in December 2008 after he confessed his multi-billion dollar fraud to his two  sons and they reported him to the FBI. He pleaded guilty to 11 federal felonies in March 2009. The charges included securities fraud, wire fraud, mail fraud, money laundering, making false statements, perjury, theft from an employee benefit plan and making false filings with the SEC. Mark Madoff killed himself on the second anniversary of his father's prison sentence. Andrew Madoff, who had been head of equities at his father's New York based company, died last year after a battle with lymphoma, and had previously blamed the stress caused by his father for his relapse. Madoff (left) is pictured with his wife Ruth and his son Mark, who killed himself after his father's arrest . Andrew Madoff, on the Today show with fiance Catherine Hooper, left, and mother Ruth Madoff, right, said he would never forgive his father - not even on his death bed . Earlier this year 76-year-old Madoff wrote a letter from prison saying the pain he inflicted on victims of his Ponzi scheme is nothing compared to having to deal with losing both his sons. Defrauded Madoff investors have long viewed the convicted swindler's sons, wife and other family member suspiciously, arguing it is impossible that they did not know about his lies. But they were never criminally charged - and never forgave him. The allegations about Madoff's advances towards his dealer's girlfriend are contained in Rogers' book The Ganja Godfather.","Bernie Madoff is serving 150 years in prison for $65billion Ponzi style fraud .
